Gloves can also keep you from scratching in your sleep. Avoid too much bathing and hand washing. It will dry out your skin. Steer clear of alcohol-based hand cleaners, too. Limit your contact with skin irritants. Household cleaners, laundry detergents, perfumed soaps, bubble baths, cosmetics, and many other things can make eczema worse. Learn what irritates your skin so you can avoid it. Choose cotton clothes that fit comfortably. Wool and synthetic fibers can be irritating. Also, be sure to wash new clothes before you wear them for the first time. Use fragrance-free laundry soap, and rinse your laundry thoroughly. Avoid getting overheated. When you're hot and sweaty, it can trigger itching and scratching. After a workout, rinse off right away in a warm shower. Know your triggers.
