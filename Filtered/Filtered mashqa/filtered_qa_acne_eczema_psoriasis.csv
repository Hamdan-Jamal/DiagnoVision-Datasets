Most are done in the doctor's office or as an outpatient procedure at the hospital. Skin resurfacing. The goal is to remove damaged layers of skin so that new, healthy skin appears. There are three major ways your doctor can do this: Laser. A laser creates a more even surface to your skin. Dermabrasion. A rapidly spinning wheel with a rough surface removes damaged skin. Chemical peel. A special type of acid removes the top layer of your skin. This can help with deeper scars. New skin will begin to form about 7 to 10 days after resurfacing. The area may stay pink from several weeks to several months. Fillers. Your doctor puts a filler (collagen or fat) into the damaged area with a needle. It puffs up the skin under the scar to help smooth it out. Because your body slowly absorbs the filler, the process needs to be repeated from time to time. Rolling (or needling). The doctor rolls a device covered in tiny needles over your skin. It's a safe way to stimulate the tissue under it to grow. You may have to do it several times. Surgery. Some people need an operation to remove bad acne scars or cysts. Your doctor cuts away or loosens the scars. The area is then repaired with stitches or a skin graft (skin from another area of the body). PRP. Platelet-rich plasma is taken from your own blood and injected into scars once a month for 4 months. Regardless of which procedure you may be considering, you'll have questions. Make a list and bring it to the appointment. Here are some you may want to ask: Will I need other treatments?

"When you're a teenager, it's not unusual to have a pimple or two. But if you have large, red, and painful breakouts deep in your skin, it could mean you've developed something called cystic acne. These breakouts can be treated. Don't try to wait them out. Cystic acne can linger for years. It can affect large areas of your skin and leave permanent scars. A dermatologist can help you with a treatment plan. You get a pimple when a pore in your skin gets clogged, usually with dead skin cells. Sometimes bacteria get trapped inside the pore, too, causing the area to become red and swollen. var s_context; s_context= s_context || {}; s_context['wb.modimp'] = 'vidfloat'; if(webmd.useragent && webmd.useragent.ua.type === 'desktop'){ webmd.ads2.disable Initial Load(); webmd.ads2.disable Ads Init = true; $(function() { webmd.p.pim.increment(); $('.responsive-video-container').insert After('.module-social-share-container'); require(['video2/1/responsive-player/video-loader'], function(video Loader) { video Loader.init({ autoplay: webmd.useragent.ua.type === 'desktop' && ! !s_sensitive, chron ID: $('article embeded_module[type=video][align=top]:eq(0)').attr('chronic_id'), continuous Play: true, cp Options: { flyout: true }, display Ads: true, mode: 'in-article', sticky: true }) }); }); } else { $(function(){ $('.responsive-video-container').remove(); }); } Cystic acne happens when this infection goes deep into your skin, creating a red, tender bump that's full of pus. It may hurt or itch. If a cyst bursts, the infection can spread, causing more breakouts. You're most likely to develop cystic acne in your teens or early 20s. But it can strike someone as young as 8 or as old as 50. Your face, chest, back, upper arms, or shoulders can be affected. Severe cystic acne is more common in men, but women get it, too. Women often have cysts on the lower half of the face. No one is sure of the exact cause, but hormones called androgens play a part. When you're a teenager, androgens increase. This leads to changes in your skin that can result in clogged pores and acne. In women, hormone changes can be brought on by menstrual cycles, pregnancy, menopause, or a condition called polycystic ovary syndrome. If one of your parents had severe cystic acne, you have a greater chance of getting it. Over-the-counter medicines that work on milder acne often have little effect on cystic acne. A dermatologist will likely recommend one or more of the following: Oral antibiotics help control bacteria and lower inflammation. Sometimes your acne may not respond to antibiotics, though. Or you may find they don't work as well after a few years. Birth-control pills help some women by regulating their hormones. Prescription-strength creams, lotions, or gels with retinoid, a form of vitamin A, can help unplug your pores and help antibiotics do their job. Isotretinoin (formally known as Accutane but now available as the brands Claravis, Sotret, Myorisan, Amnesteem, and Absorica) attacks all causes of acne. The recommended dosage for most of these medications is to take a pill once or twice daily for about 5 months. For most people, this clears the skin completely and permanently. If it recurs, you can repeat the treatment. Women should avoid becoming pregnant while taking this drug. Spironolactone is a medication that helps you get rid of unneeded water, but also is effective for cystic acne in women. Injections of steroids into individual cysts can be performed at your doctor's office. See More: Birth Control for Acne Don't touch cysts or pick at these blemishes. You may push the infection deeper and make it spread. Try to relax. Stress can cause your body to release more hormones, which can make acne worse. Follow a healthy lifestyle.

The recommended dosage for most of these medications is to take a pill once or twice daily for about 5 months. For most people, this clears the skin completely and permanently. If it recurs, you can repeat the treatment. Women should avoid becoming pregnant while taking this drug. Spironolactone is a medication that helps you get rid of unneeded water, but also is effective for cystic acne in women. Injections of steroids into individual cysts can be performed at your doctor's office. See More: Birth Control for Acne Don't touch cysts or pick at these blemishes. You may push the infection deeper and make it spread. Try to relax. Stress can cause your body to release more hormones, which can make acne worse. Follow a healthy lifestyle.

But they may be having something else: a reaction called food intolerance. What's the difference? A food allergy is caused by your immune system reacting to the food when it doesn't need to. With a food intolerance, your immune system isn't responsible. Most of the time it's a problem with digesting the food. For example, being allergic to milk is different from not being able to digest it properly because of lactose intolerance. Some people come from families where allergies are common -- not necessarily food allergies, but perhaps hay fever, asthma, or hives. When both of your parents have allergies, you're more likely to have food allergies than if only one parent has allergies. If you think you have a food allergy, see a doctor to confirm what's triggering it and get help managing and treating it. Sometimes allergic reactions to food can be severe, even life-threatening. Food allergies involve two parts of your immune system. One is immunoglobulin E ( Ig E), a type of protein called an antibody that moves through the blood. The other is mast cells, which you have in all body tissues but especially in places like your nose, throat, lungs, skin, and digestive tract. The first time you eat a food you're allergic to, certain cells make a lot of Ig E for the part of the food that triggers your allergy, called an allergen. The Ig E gets released and attaches to the surface of mast cells. You won't have a reaction yet, but now you're set up for one. The next time you eat that food, the allergen interacts with that Ig E and triggers the mast cells to release chemicals such as histamine. Depending on the tissue they're in, these chemicals will cause various symptoms. And since some food allergens aren't broken down by the heat of cooking or by stomach acids or enzymes that digest food, they can cross into your bloodstream. From there, they can travel and cause allergic reactions throughout your body. The digestion process affects the timing and the location. You may feel itching in your mouth. Then you may have symptoms such as vomiting, diarrhea, or belly pain. Food allergens in your blood can cause a drop in blood pressure. As they reach your skin, they can trigger hives or eczema. In the lungs, they may cause wheezing. All of this takes place within a few minutes to an hour. In adults, they include: Peanuts Tree nuts, such as walnuts Shellfish, including shrimp, crayfish, lobster, and crab For children, the food allergens that most often cause problems are: Eggs Milk Peanuts Adults usually don't lose their allergies, but children do sometimes. Kids are more likely to outgrow allergies to milk, eggs, and soy than to peanuts, fish, and shrimp. The foods that you'll react to are often those that you eat regularly. In Japan, for example, you'll find rice allergy. In Scandinavia, codfish allergy is common. When you have a life-threatening allergic reaction to a certain food, your doctor will probably recommend that you avoid similar foods, too. For example, if you react to shrimp, you're probably allergic to other shellfish like crab, lobster, and crayfish. This is called cross-reactivity. Another example of cross-reactivity is oral allergy syndrome. It happens in people who are highly sensitive to ragweed. During ragweed season, when they try to eat melons, especially cantaloupe, their mouths may itch. Similarly, people who have severe birch pollen allergy may also react to apple peels. At least one type of food allergy needs more than simply eating the allergen to cause a reaction. If you have exercise-induced food allergy, you won't have a reaction unless you then do something physically active. As your body temperature goes up, you'll begin to itch, get lightheaded, and could have hives or even anaphylaxis. Fortunately, the cure is simple: Don't eat that food for a couple of hours before you work out. A differential diagnosis is the process of telling the difference between a food allergy, a food intolerance, and other illnesses. When you go to the doctor's office and say, "" I think I have a food allergy,"" they have to consider a list of other things that could cause similar symptoms and be confused with a food allergy. These include: Food poisoning Histamine toxicity Food additives, including sulfites, MSG, and dyes Lactose intolerance Gluten intolerance Other diseases Psychological triggers Foods can get contaminated with bacteria and toxins. Tainted meat sometimes mimics a food allergy when it's really a type of food poisoning. Histamine can reach high levels in cheese, some wines, and in certain kinds of fish, especially tuna and mackerel, if it hasn't been refrigerated properly. When you eat foods with a lot of histamine, you could have a reaction that looks like an allergic reaction. It's called histamine toxicity. Sulfites are made naturally during the fermentation of wine, and they're added to other foods to enhance crispness or prevent mold growth. High concentrations of sulfites can pose problems for people with severe asthma. They give off a gas called sulfur dioxide, which the person breathes in while they're eating the food. This irritates their lungs and can trigger an asthma attack. That's why the FDA banned sulfites as spray-on preservatives for fresh fruits and vegetables. But sulfites are still used in some foods. Monosodium glutamate ( MSG) is naturally in foods including tomatoes, cheese, and mushrooms. It's added to others to boost flavor. When eaten in large amounts, it can cause flushing, warmth, headache, pressure in your face, chest pain, or feelings of detachment. Yellow dye number 5 can cause hives, although that's rare. Lactose intolerance, the most common food intolerance, affects at least 1 out of 10 people. Lactase is an enzyme in the lining of the gut. It breaks down lactose, a type of sugar in milk and other dairy products. If you don't have enough lactase, you can't digest lactose. Instead, bacteria eat the lactose, which creates gas, and you can get bloating, stomach pain, and diarrhea. Your doctor can measure your body's response to lactose by testing blood samples. Gluten intolerance is related to celiac disease. It's caused by an abnormal immune response to gluten, a protein found in wheat and some other grains. Several other diseases share symptoms with food allergies, including ulcers and digestive system cancers. These can lead to vomiting, diarrhea, or cramping pain that gets worse when you eat. Some people may have a food intolerance with a psychological trigger. An unpleasant event, often during childhood, that's tied to eating a particular food can bring on a rush of unpleasant sensations when you eat that food later, even as an adult. First, the doctor asks detailed questions like: Did the reaction come on quickly, within an hour of eating the food? Did anyone else get sick? How much did you eat before the reaction started? How was the food prepared? Did you eat anything else at the same time? Did you take an antihistamine or do something else? Did it help? Does this always happen when you eat that food? These help the doctor understand what's going on and could point to another explanation. For example, if you ate fish contaminated with histamine, everyone who ate that same fish would have gotten sick, too. Some people will have a violent allergic reaction only to raw or undercooked fish because heat destroys the allergens they're sensitive to. Or other foods in the meal can delay digestion so the allergic reaction starts later. Your doctor may ask you to keep a food diary, a record of each meal and any reaction you have. This gives more detail for you both to look for patterns. You may find that the severity of your reaction is related to the amount of food that you ate. The next step might be an elimination diet, which you do with the help of your doctor. You start by not eating a suspect food, like eggs. If your symptoms go away, that strongly suggests an allergy. Then you try eating that food again to see if the symptoms come back, which confirms the diagnosis. But you can't do an elimination diet if your reactions are severe (because you wouldn't want to trigger it) or you don't have them often. If your doctor thinks a specific food allergy is likely, you may get tests to measure your allergic response. One of these is a scratch puncture test. The doctor or technician puts a drop of a solution made with the food on your forearm or back. Then they'll prick your skin with a needle through the drop and watch for swelling or redness. Skin tests are quick, simple, and relatively safe. But experts don't recommend making a diagnosis based on a skin test alone. Your skin test may show an allergy to a food without you having allergic reactions when eating that food. So your doctor will diagnose a food allergy only when you have a positive skin test and a history of reactions to the same food. If you're extremely allergic and have severe reactions, skin testing could be dangerous. It also can't be done if you have severe eczema. Instead, your doctor can use blood tests such as RAST and ELISA that measure the amount of food-specific Ig E. These tests may cost more, and results take longer. Again, a positive result doesn't necessarily mean you have a food allergy. A food challenge, or feeding test, is another way to confirm or rule out an allergy. It's done with your doctor there. You eat small servings of food every 15-30 minutes that have increasing amounts of the suspected allergen in them until you either have a reaction or eat a meal-sized portion. In a ""double-blind"" test, neither you or your doctor know if what you're eating has the allergen in it. This type of testing is actually most common when the doctor believes that your reaction is not from a specific food. The test can provide evidence to look elsewhere to find the real cause of the reaction. Of course, people with severe reactions can't do food challenges, and it's hard to test more than one food allergy at the same time. It's also expensive because it takes a lot of time. Some techniques can't effectively identify food allergies. These include: Cytotoxicity testing. A food allergen is added to your blood sample. A technician then checks the sample under the microscope to see if white cells in the blood ""die."" Sublingual or subcutaneous provocative challenge. It's similar to a skin test, but the sample of food allergen goes under your tongue or gets injected under your skin. Immune complex assay. This blood test looks for groups of certain antibodies bound to the food allergen. But these clusters normally form as part of food digestion, and everyone, if tested with a sensitive enough measurement, has them. Ig G subclass assay. This blood test looks specifically for certain kinds of Ig G antibody, but they're part of a normal immune response. The main way to deal with food allergies is to avoid them. For highly allergic people, even tiny amounts of an allergen (as little as 1/44,000 of a peanut kernel) can trigger a reaction. Less-sensitive people may be able to have small amounts of a food that they're allergic to. Once you've identified the food, you have to stop eating it. That may mean reading long, detailed ingredient lists because many allergy-triggering foods are in things you wouldn't expect to find them in. Peanuts, for example, may be included for protein, and eggs are in some salad dressings. At restaurants, you might have to ask about the ingredients that are in specific dishes or in the kitchen. Even people who are very careful can make a mistake, so if you have severe food allergies, you must be prepared to treat an accidental exposure. If you've had anaphylactic reactions to a food, you should wear a medical alert bracelet or necklace. And you should carry two auto-injectors of epinephrine ( Adrenaclick, Auvi- Q, Epi Pen) and be ready to use them if you think a reaction is starting. Mild symptoms such as tingling in your mouth and throat or an upset stomach might not be an allergic reaction, but you should still give yourself an injection. It won't hurt, and it could save your life. Then call 911 or get a ride to the emergency room. Parents and caregivers should protect children from their trigger foods and know what to do if the child eats one. Schools should have plans in place to address any related emergency. Medications can help relieve food allergy symptoms that aren't part of an anaphylactic reaction: Antihistamines for digestive issues, hives, and sneezing and a runny nose Bronchodilators for tightened airways or asthma-like symptoms But these won't prevent an allergic reaction if you take them before eating the food. No medication can. Putting a dilute solution of a food under your tongue about a half hour before you eat it as a way to ""neutralize"" your exposure doesn't work either. Allergy pills and shots are being studied as way to desensitize people to food allergens. You regularly get small amounts of food extracts over a long period of time to help your body build up a kind of tolerance. But researchers haven't yet proven that allergy shots work for food allergies. Milk and soy allergies are particularly common in infants and young children, probably because their immune and digestive systems are still developing. These allergies can appear within days to months of birth. They may not show up as hives and asthma, but rather lead to colic and perhaps blood in poop or poor growth. Typically, the doctor sees a very unhappy colicky child who may not sleep well at night and diagnoses a food allergy partly by changing their diet, like switching from cow's milk to soy formula. This type of allergy tends to disappear within a few years. Doctors recommend only breastfeeding infants for the first 4-6 months, if possible, for many reasons, but there's no proof that it prevents food allergies later in life. While some pregnant women may hope limiting their diets while they're pregnant or breastfeeding may help their children avoid allergies, the experts disagree and don't suggest it. Soy formula isn't a good way to prevent allergies either. Although some people think certain illnesses can be caused by food allergies, evidence doesn't back up such claims. Histamines in cheese or red wine, for example, can trigger migraines. But we can't say that food allergies actually cause migraines. Rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis aren't made worse by foods. Food allergies don't cause ""allergic tension fatigue syndrome,"" where people get tired, nervous, and may have problems concentrating or headaches. Cerebral allergy is a term that describes when mast cells are supposedly releasing their chemicals in the brain -- and nowhere else in the body -- causing trouble concentrating and headaches. Most doctors don't recognize cerebral allergy as a disorder. Even when their surroundings are very clean, some people have many general complaints like problems concentrating, fatigue, or depression. Environmental illness may be the result of small amounts of allergens or toxins, but not food allergies. Researchers have found that hyperactivity in children may be related to food additives, but only occasionally and only when the child has had a lot of them. A food allergy won't directly affect a child's behavior, although their symptoms might make them cranky and difficult, and allergy medications can make them sleepy.",What affects food-related allergic reactions?,False,"['The digestion process affects the timing and the location.

"When your immune system is on point, it's a lifesaver. But as good as it may be, it's not perfect. Sometimes, this group of special cells, tissues, and organs doesn't act the way it should. If it kicks into action too often, you may get a condition like allergies, asthma, or eczema. Or if your immune system starts to attack your body instead of safeguarding it, you could have an autoimmune disorder like rheumatoid arthritis or type 1 diabetes. At least 80 illnesses are caused by immune system problems. They can all cause inflammation. But do you know the other warning signs? Keep in mind that these possible clues can happen for many other reasons. To figure out what's going on with your health, you'll want to see your doctor. If your blood vessels are inflamed, it can be harder for your fingers, toes, ears, and nose to keep warm. The skin in these areas may turn white, then blue, when you're exposed to the cold. Once blood flow returns, the skin may then turn red. Doctors call this â Raynaud's phenomenon.â Immune system problems can cause it, but so can other things, including smoking, some prescription drugs, and conditions that affect your arteries. Diarrhea that lasts more than 2 to 4 weeks can be a warning sign that your immune system is harming the lining of your small intestine or digestive tract. Constipation is a concern, too. If your bowel movements are hard to pass, very firm, or look like they're made up of small rabbit pellets, your immune system may be forcing your intestine to slow down. Other possible causes include bacteria, viruses, and other health conditions. If you have an autoimmune disorder, that means your immune system attacks your body instead of defending it. Rheumatoid arthritis and lupus are two examples. Many people who have an autoimmune disorder find that they have dry eyes. You might feel a sandy, gritty feeling like something is in your eye. Or you may notice pain, redness, a stringy discharge, or blurred vision. Some people find they can't cry even when they're upset. Feeling extremely tired, like you do when you have the flu, could mean something's going on with your body's defenses. Sleep is unlikely to help. Your joints or muscles can ache, too. Again, there could be many other reasons why you feel this way. If you're running a higher temperature than normal, it could be that your immune system is starting to overwork. That can happen due to an oncoming infection or because you're starting to have a flare of an autoimmune condition. In some cases, headaches can be related to the immune system. For example, it could be vasculitis, which is inflammation of a blood vessel caused by an infection or autoimmune disease. Your skin is your body's first barrier against germs. How it looks and feels can reflect how well your immune system is doing its job. Itchy, dry, red skin is a common symptom of inflammation. So is a rash that is painful or doesn't clear up. People with lupus often get a butterfly-shaped rash across their nose and cheeks. When the lining inside your joints becomes inflamed, the area around them is tender to the touch. It might also be stiff or swollen, and it can happen with more than one joint. You may notice that it's worse in the morning. Sometimes the immune system attacks hair follicles. If you lose hair on your scalp, face, or other parts of your body, you could have a condition called alopecia areata. Strands or clumps of hair coming out can also be a symptom of lupus. If you need to take antibiotics more than twice a year (four times for children), your body may not be able to attack germs well on its own. Other red flags: Chronic sinus infections, being sick with more than four ear infections in a year (for anyone over the age of 4), or having pneumonia more than once. People with an autoimmune disorder sometimes have an allergic reaction to ultraviolet ( UV) rays called photodermatitis. You may get blisters, a rash, or scaly patches after being in the sun. Or you may get chills, a headache, or nausea. It can be completely innocent. But in some cases it can mean that your body is attacking nerves that send signals to your muscles. People who have Guillain- Barre syndrome, for instance, may have numbness that starts in their legs then moves up to their arms and chest. Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy ( CIDP) has symptoms similar to the demyelinating form of GBS (called acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, or AIDP), but while GBS lasts two weeks to 30 days. CIDP lasts much longer. If you have a tough time getting food down, your esophagus (the tube that carries food from your mouth to your stomach) could be swollen or too weak to work well. Some people feel like food is stuck in their throat or chest. Others gag or choke when they swallow. One of the possible causes can be a problem with your immune system. You find yourself gaining extra pounds even though your eating habits and workouts haven't changed. Or the number on your scale may drop for no clear reason. It's possible this is because of damage to your thyroid gland from an autoimmune disease. Sometimes your immune system decides to fight the skin's pigment-making cells, called melanocytes. If so, you'll start to see white patches of skin on your body. Called jaundice, it may mean that your immune system is attacking and destroying healthy liver cells. That can lead to a condition called autoimmune hepatitis.",What can happen if your immune system is working too hard?,False,"['If it kicks into action too often, you may get a condition like allergies, asthma, or eczema. Or if your immune system starts to attack your body instead of safeguarding it, you could have an autoimmune disorder like rheumatoid arthritis or type 1 diabetes.']"
"If you have psoriasis, you may have noticed patches in unexpected places. Where can it happen? How can you deal with it when it does? Nearly half of all people with psoriasis have nail problems. That goes up to 80% in those with psoriatic arthritis. If you have either, you might notice your nails are: Pitted, with âpockingâ or holes in the nail Thicker than normal or discolored Separated from the nail bed What you can do: You may be able to disguise mild nail changes by scraping, filing, or polishing your nails. Try to keep your nails short. Avoid injury to them as much as you can, too. That can make things worse. For more serious problems, your doctor may give you corticosteroid injections in your nail bed. Many people with psoriasis have a fungal infection in their nails (called onychomycosis). Ask your doctor or dermatologist to see if you have it. If so, treating the fungal infection will help your nails. If you have severe psoriasis or psoriatic arthritis, your doctor may want you to take a prescription medication that affects your whole body. That should ease nail problems, too. At least half of those with psoriasis have it here. It can cause mild scaling. That can look like and flake off like dandruff. But it's not the same. It can be severe. You can get thick, crusted patches that can cover parts or all of your scalp. It can even go past your hairline and onto your neck, ear area, and forehead. Scalp psoriasis is usually powdery looking. It may be silver in color. What you can do: Whether your condition is mild or severe, you may have to switch and combine treatments every now and then. That's because psoriasis can become resistant to a treatment after a while. If yours is mild, your dermatologist may recommend shampoos or topical solutions with tar or salicylic acid. Both lower the number of skin cells your body makes. They can ease itching, too. Your doctor may also suggest steroid scalp injections to reduce patches, or an antihistamine to deal with the itch. For more moderate to severe cases, you may get a prescription scalp ointment, liquid, cream, foam, or shampoo. Some of these have corticosteroids. If your psoriasis or psoriatic arthritis is severe and affects other areas of your body, you might be prescribed a medication that deals with all your symptoms. An example would be biologic drugs, which target specific parts of your immune system. If you notice a flare here, tell your doctor right away. It can lead to cracking, blistering, and swelling. These can be painful and raise your chances of infection. What you can do: Your first step is usually to put medicine directly on your palms and the soles of your feet. Your doctor may point you to: Tar products Salicylic acid Corticosteroid creams or ointments You'll probably have more success if you use more than one of these at a time. Your doctor may also suggest something called calcipotriene. It's a form of vitamin D. Wear cotton gloves or socks after you put it on so it can soak in without getting on other areas. If you have deep cracks in your skin, talk to your doctor about using superglue to seal them. Though this sounds odd, some dermatologists recommend it to keep cracks from getting worse. If those options don't work, you may be prescribed medicine (like methotrexate, which suppresses your immune system). He may also point you toward light therapy (also known as PUVA or UVB phototherapy). Only do that with your doctor's help. Psoriasis here is rare, but it does happen. Most of the time, patches are white or gray. They can be uncomfortable and may affect the way you talk and chew. What you can do: Talk to your doctor right away. She will probably recommend a low-potency steroid cream, like 1% hydrocortisone ointment. She may suggest a steroid-free treatment like pimecrolimus or tacrolimus, which will suppress your immune system. Psoriasis can affect your genitals. Some people only have it on their genitals. These flares are usually pink or red. They usually have little or no flaking or scaling. Psoriasis can also cause painful cracks, particularly between the buttocks. What you can do: Treating psoriasis here can be tricky. Moisturizing regularly can help. Ask your doctor about which moisturizer is best for you. Topical vitamin D creams and ointments are options, as are steroid creams. You'll usually get prescribed low-dose steroid creams or Eucrisa ointment (off-label, not FDA- approved) for a little while. That's because genital skin tends to be thin and steroid cream can make it even thinner. Coal tar products can irritate your genitals, so don't use them here. Don't use light therapy, either.

That's because psoriasis can become resistant to a treatment after a while. If yours is mild, your dermatologist may recommend shampoos or topical solutions with tar or salicylic acid. Both lower the number of skin cells your body makes. They can ease itching, too. Your doctor may also suggest steroid scalp injections to reduce patches, or an antihistamine to deal with the itch. For more moderate to severe cases, you may get a prescription scalp ointment, liquid, cream, foam, or shampoo. Some of these have corticosteroids. If your psoriasis or psoriatic arthritis is severe and affects other areas of your body, you might be prescribed a medication that deals with all your symptoms. An example would be biologic drugs, which target specific parts of your immune system. If you notice a flare here, tell your doctor right away. It can lead to cracking, blistering, and swelling.

Your doctor may point you to: Tar products Salicylic acid Corticosteroid creams or ointments You'll probably have more success if you use more than one of these at a time. Your doctor may also suggest something called calcipotriene. It's a form of vitamin D. Wear cotton gloves or socks after you put it on so it can soak in without getting on other areas. If you have deep cracks in your skin, talk to your doctor about using superglue to seal them. Though this sounds odd, some dermatologists recommend it to keep cracks from getting worse. If those options don't work, you may be prescribed medicine (like methotrexate, which suppresses your immune system). He may also point you toward light therapy (also known as PUVA or UVB phototherapy). Only do that with your doctor's help. Psoriasis here is rare, but it does happen. Most of the time, patches are white or gray. They can be uncomfortable and may affect the way you talk and chew. What you can do: Talk to your doctor right away. She will probably recommend a low-potency steroid cream, like 1% hydrocortisone ointment. She may suggest a steroid-free treatment like pimecrolimus or tacrolimus, which will suppress your immune system. Psoriasis can affect your genitals. Some people only have it on their genitals. These flares are usually pink or red. They usually have little or no flaking or scaling. Psoriasis can also cause painful cracks, particularly between the buttocks. What you can do: Treating psoriasis here can be tricky. Moisturizing regularly can help. Ask your doctor about which moisturizer is best for you. Topical vitamin D creams and ointments are options, as are steroid creams. You'll usually get prescribed low-dose steroid creams or Eucrisa ointment (off-label, not FDA- approved) for a little while. That's because genital skin tends to be thin and steroid cream can make it even thinner. Coal tar products can irritate your genitals, so don't use them here. Don't use light therapy, either.

"When you have psoriasis, it's important to follow the advice of your doctor. Still, you can do a lot on your own to help control and prevent flare-ups. Symptoms get worse when your skin is dry, so keep it moist with creams and lotions. Thick and oily ones, like petroleum jelly, are usually best. They're better at trapping moisture beneath the skin. To help remove scales, apply cream on top of them, then cover the area with plastic wrap or another waterproof material. Leave it on for a few hours, then remove. Be careful with your skin. Never pick at patches or scales, as you may make your psoriasis worse. Use caution when trimming your nails. If you cut yourself, it might make symptoms flare. If you have psoriasis on your scalp, rub your topical treatments -- such as tar shampoos -- into your scalp. Regular bathing with soothing products, such as tar solutions, may bring relief, too. Climate can have a big effect on psoriasis. For many people, cold, dry weather makes symptoms worse. Hot weather usually makes it better, but not always. It's important to keep your skin moist. Turn on the humidifier when the air inside your house is dry. Let your doctor know about all the medications you take, even over-the-counter ones. Ask if they could affect your psoriasis. Drugs that are known to make things worse include: Lithium , used to treat psychiatric disorders Propranolol and possibly other beta-blockers, which are prescribed for heart conditions Quinidine ( Cardioquin or Quinidex), medications for heart arrhythmias If you're using any of these medications, ask your doctor about substitutes. It's extra important for people with psoriasis to avoid bumps and cuts. Trauma to the skin can cause a flare, a condition called "" Koebner's phenomenon."" Infections can also cause problems. Be especially careful when shaving. Avoid acupuncture, tattoos, and do your best to prevent insect bites and chafing. The ultraviolet rays in sunlight slow the growth of skin cells, so getting moderate doses of sun is good. But make it brief -- about 20 minutes or so at a time. And use sunscreen. Sunburn can trigger psoriasis, and it raises your risk of skin cancer. Some medications can make your skin more sensitive to ultraviolet rays, so talk to your doctor first. Although it hasn't been proven, many people link flare-ups to stress. So, try to relieve your anxiety. That may be easier said than done, but you can try relaxation techniques like meditation or yoga, for starters. The connection between alcohol and psoriasis isn't clear, but some think it can worsen symptoms, especially in men. Alcohol can be dangerous if you're using certain psoriasis drugs, so check with your doctor. Although no studies have shown a link between diet and psoriasis, experts recommend that people with the condition eat a well-balanced diet that's high in fruits and vegetables.

Symptoms get worse when your skin is dry, so keep it moist with creams and lotions. Thick and oily ones, like petroleum jelly, are usually best. They're better at trapping moisture beneath the skin. To help remove scales, apply cream on top of them, then cover the area with plastic wrap or another waterproof material. Leave it on for a few hours, then remove. Be careful with your skin. Never pick at patches or scales, as you may make your psoriasis worse. Use caution when trimming your nails. If you cut yourself, it might make symptoms flare. If you have psoriasis on your scalp, rub your topical treatments -- such as tar shampoos -- into your scalp. Regular bathing with soothing products, such as tar solutions, may bring relief, too. Climate can have a big effect on psoriasis. For many people, cold, dry weather makes symptoms worse. Hot weather usually makes it better, but not always. It's important to keep your skin moist. Turn on the humidifier when the air inside your house is dry. Let your doctor know about all the medications you take, even over-the-counter ones. Ask if they could affect your psoriasis. Drugs that are known to make things worse include: Lithium , used to treat psychiatric disorders Propranolol and possibly other beta-blockers, which are prescribed for heart conditions Quinidine ( Cardioquin or Quinidex), medications for heart arrhythmias If you're using any of these medications, ask your doctor about substitutes. It's extra important for people with psoriasis to avoid bumps and cuts. Trauma to the skin can cause a flare, a condition called "" Koebner's phenomenon."" Infections can also cause problems. Be especially careful when shaving. Avoid acupuncture, tattoos, and do your best to prevent insect bites and chafing. The ultraviolet rays in sunlight slow the growth of skin cells, so getting moderate doses of sun is good. But make it brief -- about 20 minutes or so at a time. And use sunscreen. Sunburn can trigger psoriasis, and it raises your risk of skin cancer. Some medications can make your skin more sensitive to ultraviolet rays, so talk to your doctor first. Although it hasn't been proven, many people link flare-ups to stress. So, try to relieve your anxiety. That may be easier said than done, but you can try relaxation techniques like meditation or yoga, for starters. The connection between alcohol and psoriasis isn't clear, but some think it can worsen symptoms, especially in men. Alcohol can be dangerous if you're using certain psoriasis drugs, so check with your doctor. Although no studies have shown a link between diet and psoriasis, experts recommend that people with the condition eat a well-balanced diet that's high in fruits and vegetables. Some people say their symptoms improve when they remove dairy or gluten. Exercise may also help. Some studies show excess weight can trigger flares, so stay at a healthy weight.",Can skin injuries cause a psoriasis flare-up?,False,"['It\'s important to keep your skin moist.

"With so many over-the-counter ( OTC) allergy products in the store, it can be hard to know which one to take. Or do you need a prescription? Both prescribed and OTC drugs are regulated by the FDA to ensure that they're safe and effective when you follow the directions. But all medications have side effects. Some medications can cause problems when you're taking other medicines, too. Given all the options and things to consider, it's best to work with your doctor or allergy specialist to figure out whether an OTC or prescription medication is right for you. You'll want to tell them about your symptoms and any medicines you've tried in the past. You don't need a prescription to buy OTC medicine. For the medications that you think of as prescription, you do. Sometimes, the same drug comes in both OTC and prescription versions. The difference is often the strength. For example, hydrocortisone can treat skin reactions including itching and redness. If you're bothered by an insect bite, you can get an OTC cream or spray with a concentration of 1% or less. But for a more severe reaction like eczema, your doctor may prescribe 2.5% hydrocortisone cream or ointment. In other cases, a prescription medication works in a different way than what you can buy over the counter. If you have hay fever, you can treat the sneezing and stuffy, itchy nose with an OTC antihistamine such as cetirizine ( Zyrtec), fexofenadine ( Allegra), or loratadine ( Claritin). These block chemicals called histamines, which your body releases when your allergy is triggered. Or your doctor could prescribe a medication like montelukast ( Singulair), which blocks a different chemical so your body won't react as much. Another difference might be how long it takes for you to feel better. Those OTC antihistamines typically start working in about an hour, but it may be a couple of days before the prescription really kicks in. Most OTC medicines, including antihistamines and nasal steroids, are safe to use as directed for as long as your symptoms last, but there are some exceptions. Don't use a decongestant nasal spray for more than 3 days unless your doctor says to. It could stop working and make your stuffiness worse. Talk to your doctor about other potential risks. One study found a link between dementia and using high doses of some OTC antihistamines for many years, such as diphenhydramine ( Benadryl). When your allergies could be life-threatening or get in the way of living your life, you should see a specialist, called an allergist. You may need a prescription if your allergy symptoms are: Several months out of the year Causing a stuffy nose, trouble breathing, or sinus infections that won't go away Affecting your day-to-day activities Not controlled by OTC medications, or those medicines cause unpleasant side effects If you're taking a prescription medicine for your allergies, ask your doctor before you also take an OTC medication, especially an antihistamine, for those same symptoms. Using some medicines together can cause more side effects or even set off a dangerous reaction. Tell your doctor about everything you take: all the pain relievers, remedies, vitamins, and supplements, too. Your doctor might also write a prescription for an OTC medicine so that it's covered by your health insurance. You'll need to check the rules for your plan -- your copay and your flexible spending account or your health savings account -- to figure out what's going to cost less. Kids may be able to use the same OTC products as adults, but in smaller doses. Follow the directions on the label. Some OTC medicines are made specifically for children, like antihistamine syrups and chewable tablets. Call your child's doctor or check with a pharmacist if you have any questions.",When do you need a prescription to buy over-the-counter (OTC) allergy medicines?,False,"[""You don't need a prescription to buy OTC medicine.

"It's important to get the right treatment for your uveitis as soon as you can. If it's not taken care of, uveitis can lead to serious eye problems, including blindness. Your treatment plan should include things to control your inflammation. Treatment can also: Ease eye pain Prevent the damage to your eyes from getting worse Help get back eyesight you've lost What your doctor will prescribe depends on what kind of uveitis you have, where it is in your eye, and if you have it in both eyes. If your first course doesn't work well, your doctor can switch you to something else. You may know these as steroids. They're probably the first treatment you'll try. They block a chemical that causes inflammation. They can be given in a few different forms. Eye drops. If your uveitis is at the front of your eye and isn't caused by an infection, steroid drops probably will be your first treatment. How often you'll put these drops in will depend on how much your eyes are inflamed. Use them until your doctor tells you it's OK to stop. You may have short-term blurred vision. Your doctor also may give you mydriatic eye drops to take with your steroids. These drops dilate your pupil, relax your eye muscles, and ease pain. They can lower your risk of glaucoma, too. Shots. You may need these if your uveitis is in the middle or back of your eye, or if your eye drops don't work. The good news is that you may only need one shot. The bad news is that you'll get it in your eye, usually on the side. Your eye doctor can give you drops to numb the area so you don't feel the shot. Pills. If your uveitis doesn't respond to drops or shots, oral steroids are an option. They can also work if you have disease in the back of your eye. They're much stronger than other forms of steroids. Take your steroid pills for as long as your doctor says. Your dose will get smaller toward the end of your treatment. If the pills don't work, you'll probably try something else. If you take steroid pills for a short time, you may have side effects. They can include: Weight gain Acne Anxiety Mood changes Sleeplessness In the long term, they can cause more serious problems like: Osteoporosis Cataracts Glaucoma Diabetes Because of all this, you'll take the lowest dose you need, and only for as long as you have to. If your uveitis is caused by a viral or bacterial infection, you may need to take an antibiotic or another medication used to fight that type of infection. Once the infection clears, your uveitis should, too. It's not likely, but uveitis can happen when your immune system attacks your body by mistake. That's also known as autoimmunity. In that case, you might need to take a drug that powers down your immune system to stop the inflammation. The drugs you'd take are called immunosuppressants. They include: Azathioprine Cyclosporine Methotrexate Mycophenolate You may need to have blood tests regularly while you take these. This would be to watch for serious side effects, like liver damage. Biologic drugs target certain parts of your immune system to stop inflammation. You may need these if other uveitis treatments don't work well enough. Biologics your doctor may prescribe include: Abatacept ( Orencia) Adalimumab ( Humira) Daclizumab ( Zinbryta) Infliximab ( Remicade) Rituximab ( Rituxan) These drugs can make it harder for you to fight off infections. They also may raise your chance of having certain types of cancer. If your uveitis is severe, if it keeps coming back after treatment, or if it's caused by some infections, surgeries like these may help: Vitrectomy. Your eye surgeon can take out part of the gel inside your eye, known as your vitreous humor. Air, gas, or liquid is pumped in to replace what your surgeon takes out, but your eye will eventually fill up the space with its own fluid. You can have this under either local or general anesthesia. Implant surgery. A tiny capsule is put into your eye that slowly releases steroids to treat your inflammation. It's used on uveitis in the back of the eye that's harder to treat. The implant stays in for roughly 2 to 3 years. You might also try these therapies to ease symptoms. They won't treat the cause of your uveitis: Drugs for mild pain, like ibuprofen A warm towel over your eye to ease aches Sunglasses in bright or harsh light to cut glare",What are the long term problems of oral steroids that treat uveitis?,False,"[""They can include: Weight gain Acne Anxiety Mood changes Sleeplessness In the long term, they can cause more serious problems like: Osteoporosis Cataracts Glaucoma Diabetes Because of all this, you'll take the lowest dose you need, and only for as long as you have to.""]"

"Don't feel bad if you get lupus and psoriatic arthritis mixed up, because they share some symptoms. If you've got pain and swelling in your joints, it could be a sign of either disease. Your doctor can set you straight, but there are some key ways to tell them apart. Lupus affects everybody differently. The way you feel may not be the same as your friend who also has the disease. Most folks will get flares, which means the condition gets worse at certain times and then gets better. The symptoms can come on slowly or suddenly, and can be permanent or temporary. Some things you may notice if you have lupus are: A rash shaped like a butterfly that covers your nose and cheeks You feel tired Pain, stiffness, or swelling in your joints Fever Sensitivity to sun or light that causes skin lesions White or blue color in your fingers and toes when you're in the cold or feel stressed Headaches or chest pain Ulcers in your mouth or nose Hair loss Low numbers of blood cells (anemia) Swelling in your hands, feet, or legs Like lupus, your symptoms sometimes get better and sometimes flare up. You may get tired and have pain, swelling, and warmth in your joints. If you have psoriatic arthritis you may get problems like: Severe swelling in your fingers or toes Foot pain, often at the bottom or the heel Pain in your lower back Scaly patches on your skin that flake Pitted or discolored nails It starts when your immune system -- your body's defense against germs -- attacks your own organs and tissues. The disease causes inflammation and can affect different parts of your body, including your heart, skin, brain, and blood cells. Experts don't know the exact cause of lupus. They think it may be related to genes that put you at risk for lupus and things you come into contact with that trigger the disease. Some of those triggers are: Sunlight Infections Medications like blood pressure or anti-seizure drugs Psoriatic arthritis can happen if you have psoriasis, a condition that causes your skin to get red patches and silvery scales. Sometimes people get psoriasis first and then have psoriatic arthritis later, but others get the arthritis symptoms first. Like lupus, psoriatic arthritis happens when your immune system attacks your healthy cells and tissues. This causes your joints to get inflamed and your skin to make too many cells. It's not clear what causes the immune system to attack your body when you have psoriatic arthritis, but just like lupus, it's likely that genes and triggers play a role. There's no single test that shows you have lupus. Your doctor will do a physical exam and may ask you to get some blood and urine tests that give clues about your condition. He may also suggest you get a chest X-ray to look for fluid or inflammation in your lungs or an echocardiogram to see if you have problems with your heart. Your doctor may say you have lupus if you have at least four of 11 signs of the disease that are laid out by experts at the American College of Rheumatology: Butterfly-shaped rash Raised red patches on your skin You're sensitive to light Ulcers in your mouth or nose Arthritis in two or more joints, plus swelling or tenderness Inflammation in the lining of your heart or lungs Seizures or other nerve problems Too much protein in your urine Low blood cell counts Certain antibodies in your blood Results from a blood test called an ANA test that suggest you may have too many ""antinuclear"" antibodies, which could be a sign of lupus To check if you have psoriatic arthritis, you may need to get certain tests like X-rays to look at changes in your bones or joints, and blood tests that check for inflammation. Your doctor may also do a physical exam to see if you have inflammation and swelling in your joints or signs of psoriasis on your skin and nails. He will ask you about your medical history. Your doctor will probably rule out other conditions that can cause similar symptoms. For example, if you only have swelling and pain in a single joint, you may have gout.

How you treat the itching, though, depends a lot on the cause of the problem. It may just be dry skin, which can be brought on by winter weather or too much scrubbing. But sometimes, itchy hands and feet can signal another health condition. Could It Be Psoriasis? Psoriasis happens when skin cells grow too fast and then pile up on the skin's surface. It's a long-lasting condition that usually runs in families. There are a few different types, and itchiness of the palms and soles is a common symptom. If you have psoriasis, you may also have: Patches of red skin, bumps filled with puss, or silver scales Painful, swollen, or stiff joints Soreness of the affected area Itchiness in other places like your elbows, knees, lower back, and face Could It Be Eczema? Eczema is a term for a group of conditions that inflame the skin. There are several different types that can show up anywhere on the body. But one type, called dyshidrotic dermatitis, affects only the hands and feet. Besides the urge to scratch, symptoms of dyshidrotic dermatitis include: Clear blisters Red, cracked skin Scaly skin Could It Be Scabies? An eight-legged bug, called the human itch mite, is the source of this common skin condition. The tiny pest digs into the top layer of your skin and lays eggs there, causing scabies. The condition tends to spread in very crowded areas, where people have a lot of skin-to-skin contact that happens over a long time. You usually can't get scabies from quick touching, like a handshake or a hug. Itchy hands and feet are common in infants and young kids with scabies, but not adults. It also causes: Itchiness, especially at night, of the entire body or specific areas, like the wrist, elbow, armpit, and the webbing between fingers Pimply rash Tiny blisters and scales Sores Grayish-white or skin-colored âburrowsâ that look like lines Could It Be Diabetes? A skin problem is sometimes the first sign that you have diabetes. One of these skin conditions is eruptive xanthomatosis, which can make hands and feet itch. It's caused by out-of-control diabetes, and it goes away when the disease is managed well. It can also make you itchy on your arms, legs, and buttocks. Other signs of eruptive xanthomatosis: Small, yellow bumps on the skin Redness around the bumps High cholesterol Could It Be Allergies? Your skin can have an allergic reaction to something you touch. The response you see and feel is another type of eczema called allergic contact dermatitis. Symptoms may not appear for a few hours after you touch the item you're allergic to. When they do appear, you may feel itchy and have: Rash Very dry skin Burning and stinging Hives Blisters In general, the answer hinges on what's making your hands and feet itch. Ointments, creams, and lotions can help when dry skin is to blame. If those don't keep you from scratching, talk to your doctor to figure out what's right for you. An allergic reaction may need antihistamines or corticosteroids, whether over-the-counter or prescribed by your doctor. Some products treat scabies by killing the mites on your body.

"Almost all teens get acne. It happens when an oily substance called sebum clogs pores. Pimples usually pop up on the face, neck, back, chest, and shoulders. Acne isn't a serious health risk, though severe acne can cause permanent scars. Acne can also damage self-esteem. Acne can appear as one of the following: Whiteheads: White dots that are pores impacted with oil and skin covered by skin layers. Blackheads: Black bumps that are impacted pores in which material pushes out through the follicles. The black color is not from dirt. It may be from bacteria, dead skin cells, and matter that react with oxygen. Papules, pustules or nodules: More serious lesions appearing red and swollen due to inflammation or infection of the tissue around the clogged follicles, which are often painful and feel hard. Cysts: Deep, pus-filled pimples. It is not clear why some people are more prone to acne than others. The exact cause of acne is not known, but hormones called androgens can play a role. Androgens increase in both boys and girls during puberty. Androgens make the skin's oil glands get larger and make more sebum. Androgens also can increase because of hormonal changes related to pregnancy or starting or stopping birth control pills. Genetics may also matter. If your parents had acne, you may have inherited that tendency. Some medications (for example, androgens taken as medicine, epilepsy medication, lithium, and prednisone) can cause acne. Cosmetics that have a greasy consistency may also clog pores. Water-based products are less likely to cause acne than oil-based makeup. Other things that can make acne worse include: Friction caused by leaning on or rubbing the skin; harsh scrubbing Picking or squeezing blemishes Pressure from bike helmets, backpacks, or tight collars Changing hormone levels in adolescent girls and adult women two to seven days before the start of the menstrual period Stress Dermatologists (doctors who specialize in skin problems) often treat acne, particularly in severe cases. Family or general practitioners, pediatricians, or internists can treat milder forms of acne. Treatments may include: Nonprescription (""over the counter"") topical treatments: "" Topical"" means that you put these products on your skin. They're not pills. These include acetic acid, benzoyl peroxide, salicylic acid, and sulfur. These treatments are available in many forms including gels, lotions, creams, soaps, and pads. When these products are used regularly, they are moderately effective in treating acne. It may take 4-8 weeks for skin to improve. Prescription topical treatments: These include adapalene, antibiotics, azelaic acid, benzoyl peroxide, dapsone, tazarotene, and tretinoin. Prescription oral drug treatments: For people with moderate to severe acne, doctors often prescribe oral antibiotics (pills) in addition to topical medication. Oral antibiotics are thought to help control acne by curbing the growth of bacteria, thereby decreasing inflammation. They are usually taken daily for four to six months and then tapered and discontinued as acne improves. The most potent oral drug, isotretinoin ( Absorica, Amnesteem, Claravis, Myorisan and Zenatane), is usually taken once or twice a day for 16 to 20 weeks. It is believed to reduce the size of the oil glands so that much less oil is produced and to help prevent clogged pores. That curbs the growth of acne-causing bacteria. Because of the risk of birth defects, women of childbearing age must not be pregnant and must not become pregnant while taking isotretinoin. In office treatments: Cysts can be treated with a series of intralesional cortisone injections. A red light therapy can be used to decrease inflammation and bacteria on the skin. A salicylic acid peel can be used to unclog the pores. Here are tips that may help control acne. Don't over-wash or use harsh scrubs. Acne is not caused by dirt. Two gentle washings a day is enough.

"Almost all teens get acne. It happens when an oily substance called sebum clogs pores. Pimples usually pop up on the face, neck, back, chest, and shoulders. Acne isn't a serious health risk, though severe acne can cause permanent scars. Acne can also damage self-esteem. Acne can appear as one of the following: Whiteheads: White dots that are pores impacted with oil and skin covered by skin layers. Blackheads: Black bumps that are impacted pores in which material pushes out through the follicles. The black color is not from dirt. It may be from bacteria, dead skin cells, and matter that react with oxygen. Papules, pustules or nodules: More serious lesions appearing red and swollen due to inflammation or infection of the tissue around the clogged follicles, which are often painful and feel hard. Cysts: Deep, pus-filled pimples. It is not clear why some people are more prone to acne than others. The exact cause of acne is not known, but hormones called androgens can play a role. Androgens increase in both boys and girls during puberty. Androgens make the skin's oil glands get larger and make more sebum. Androgens also can increase because of hormonal changes related to pregnancy or starting or stopping birth control pills. Genetics may also matter. If your parents had acne, you may have inherited that tendency. Some medications (for example, androgens taken as medicine, epilepsy medication, lithium, and prednisone) can cause acne. Cosmetics that have a greasy consistency may also clog pores. Water-based products are less likely to cause acne than oil-based makeup. Other things that can make acne worse include: Friction caused by leaning on or rubbing the skin; harsh scrubbing Picking or squeezing blemishes Pressure from bike helmets, backpacks, or tight collars Changing hormone levels in adolescent girls and adult women two to seven days before the start of the menstrual period Stress Dermatologists (doctors who specialize in skin problems) often treat acne, particularly in severe cases. Family or general practitioners, pediatricians, or internists can treat milder forms of acne. Treatments may include: Nonprescription (""over the counter"") topical treatments: "" Topical"" means that you put these products on your skin. They're not pills. These include acetic acid, benzoyl peroxide, salicylic acid, and sulfur. These treatments are available in many forms including gels, lotions, creams, soaps, and pads. When these products are used regularly, they are moderately effective in treating acne. It may take 4-8 weeks for skin to improve. Prescription topical treatments: These include adapalene, antibiotics, azelaic acid, benzoyl peroxide, dapsone, tazarotene, and tretinoin. Prescription oral drug treatments: For people with moderate to severe acne, doctors often prescribe oral antibiotics (pills) in addition to topical medication. Oral antibiotics are thought to help control acne by curbing the growth of bacteria, thereby decreasing inflammation. They are usually taken daily for four to six months and then tapered and discontinued as acne improves. The most potent oral drug, isotretinoin ( Absorica, Amnesteem, Claravis, Myorisan and Zenatane), is usually taken once or twice a day for 16 to 20 weeks. It is believed to reduce the size of the oil glands so that much less oil is produced and to help prevent clogged pores. That curbs the growth of acne-causing bacteria. Because of the risk of birth defects, women of childbearing age must not be pregnant and must not become pregnant while taking isotretinoin. In office treatments: Cysts can be treated with a series of intralesional cortisone injections. A red light therapy can be used to decrease inflammation and bacteria on the skin.

"When you have Crohn's disease, you want to prevent flare-ups and keep them away for good. Inflammation in your intestines causes symptoms like belly pain and diarrhea. Anti-inflammatory drugs ease them and may even keep them away for years. Although they aren't a cure, they can help you feel much better. Your doctor will help you decide which one is best for you. These are one of the oldest treatments for Crohn's disease. Your doctor may suggest one: If your case is mild to moderate If other drugs aren't helping If your symptoms are severe right away Your doctor may call them corticosteroids, but most people just call them steroids. They're not the same as the drugs you take to build your muscles. Most of them will cut inflammation all over your body, not just in your intestines. They work quickly during flare-ups and can ease symptoms for days after you take them. There are a few different types. Some you take by mouth, and others you get through an IV. Steroid drugs you take by mouth include: Budesonide ( Entocort EC) Prednisone ( Prednisone Intensol, Rayos) Budesonide lowers inflammation only in the intestine when you take it as a capsule. Because it's designed to dissolve in the small intestine, it may cause fewer side effects than other steroids. If your Crohn's disease is severe, or it's in many parts of your intestines, you may need a higher dose through an IV. Because they can cause serious side effects, your doctor will keep you on these steroids only as long as it takes to ease your symptoms. You may start on a large dose and then get smaller doses as you feel better. When you take steroids, you might notice one or more of these side effects: Acne Hair growth on your face Night sweats Swelling of the face (called ""moon face"") Trouble sleeping Weight gain More serious side effects include: Cataracts Diabetes Glaucoma High blood pressure Weakened bones and fractures Because steroids weaken your immune system, they can make you more likely to get an infection. Children who take them for a long time may grow more slowly than normal. There's some question about how effective these drugs are for Crohn's. Your doctor may suggest these if you have mild Crohn's disease in your large intestine (also called the colon). Once your symptoms get better, you may continue to take them to prevent flare-ups. There are two main 5- ASA drugs used in Crohn's: Mesalamine ( Apriso, Asacol, Delzicol, Lialda, Pentasa) Sulfasalazine ( Azulfidine) The main side effects are: Diarrhea Nausea Stomachache Headache Skin rash Sulfasalazine can cut sperm counts in men, and it may lower your supply of infection-fighting white blood cells. If you're allergic to sulfa drugs, you may have a reaction to sulfasalazine and shouldn't take it. If your Crohn's affects the top part of your intestinal tract, you'll probably take these medicines by mouth. If it's in the lower part, you can take them through your rectum as an enema (when you put liquid into your rectum to help start a bowel movement) or a suppository, a small, round or cone-shaped object you put into your bottom to deliver medicine.

"Your skin is thinner and more sensitive in some places, like your face, genitals, and the skin folds under your breasts and buttocks and in your groin. Psoriasis flares here can be more embarrassing, painful, and harder to treat. Some common ways to deal with psoriasis -- like managing your stress, not smoking, putting on moisturizer after a shower or bath, and getting plenty of rest -- are good for these areas, too. But others are too harsh for tender skin. You'll need to consider where your patches are when you make decisions about what to do. Keep these things in mind to protect your sensitive skin and make living with your psoriasis easier. Work closely with your doctor to find a way to control your symptoms. Let him know if anything you put on your skin burns or stings, or if you get an infection. Low-dose steroid cream. Doctors often prescribe it first because it's one of the best treatments. When you have an infection, the medicine to treat it might be mixed with a steroid. But you have to use steroids with care. Thin skin absorbs medicine more easily, so you're more likely to have side effects. A steroid cream can also make your skin even thinner and cause stretch marks or broken blood vessels if you use it too long. Your doctor will likely prescribe a low-dose steroid cream for a short time. Mild vitamin D creams. These have fewer long-term side effects than steroids, and you can use them longer. Sometimes they're mixed with a mild steroid to make them less irritating. Only use the one your doctor prescribes, since not all vitamin D creams work well for sensitive skin. Light treatments (phototherapy). UVB rays in sunlight slow the growth of skin cells and help many kinds of psoriasis. Artificial UVB light works on most parts of the body, but not your genitals. Moisturize. This is a key part of daily care for psoriasis on your whole body, including sensitive areas. A lighter texture is better for delicate skin. Go fragrance- and alcohol-free. Ceramides, lipids, and hyaluronic acid will help replace the natural moisturizers in your skin. Some people swear by oils like olive, coconut, and jojoba, too. Go soapless. Use natural cleansing milks, oils, or balms to wash your face and body instead of soap. If you do use soap, choose one without deodorant. Baby your skin. Creases and folds in your skin can get warm and damp, making them more prone to infection. Dust baby powder or baking soda under your breasts and in your groin to help skin stay cool and dry. Peeling creams. The best products to soften and remove scales have salicylic acid, lactic acid, urea, or phenol. Some over-the counter ( OTC) peels may be too strong, so check with your doctor before you use them. Avoid peels on cracked or bleeding skin. Use an OTC antibiotic that you put on the area to help heal it. A light foundation makeup is often all you need. Even when you're trying to cover severe psoriasis, choose a formula specifically meant for your face. Pick something that's not too slippery, so it sticks to your skin, but not so dry that it makes flakes worse. Match your normal skin tone; don't go darker or lighter. You may have better luck finding items at a beauty products store. It might be worth it to have a makeup artist give you some tips about what things to use and how to apply them. For example, many professionals recommend using a primer after your moisturizer and before your foundation to help even out your skin. Since your hair can touch your face and neck, your styling products could be causing irritation. Look for fragrance- and alcohol-free ones. Products with fewer ingredients, that are natural rather than chemical, are safer. Wear loose-fitting clothes and underwear, like boxers or boy shorts. Tight clothes rub on sensitive skin and can make symptoms flare. Choose natural fabrics. Clothes made from cotton or silk are kinder to your skin than synthetics. Avoid scratchy wool. Change your clothes right after exercise so sweat doesn't stay close to your skin and irritate it. Although it may sound like a good idea, workout gear made of ""moisture-wicking"" fabrics might stick to affected skin. Sometimes, especially to the untrained eye, genital psoriasis can look like an STD. Assure your partner that your skin rash isn't contagious. Use non-latex condoms to avoid problems with psoriasis treatments that make latex condoms less effective. You can find them in most supermarkets and pharmacies. Lubricants can make sex more enjoyable for both men and women. Clean your genital area afterward, and apply more medication if you need to. Let your partner know when it's not comfortable to have sex, but don't shut them out. Tell them where you do want to be touched and what feels good to you. Extra pounds can create more skin folds where psoriasis could show up. When you're heavy, you're also more likely to sweat, which can make your symptoms worse. Losing a few pounds may make a big difference to your comfort and the health of your skin.",How is low-dose steroid cream used to treat psoriasis on sensitive areas?,False,"[""Doctors often prescribe it first because it's one of the best treatments.

"Your skin is thinner and more sensitive in some places, like your face, genitals, and the skin folds under your breasts and buttocks and in your groin. Psoriasis flares here can be more embarrassing, painful, and harder to treat. Some common ways to deal with psoriasis -- like managing your stress, not smoking, putting on moisturizer after a shower or bath, and getting plenty of rest -- are good for these areas, too. But others are too harsh for tender skin. You'll need to consider where your patches are when you make decisions about what to do. Keep these things in mind to protect your sensitive skin and make living with your psoriasis easier. Work closely with your doctor to find a way to control your symptoms. Let him know if anything you put on your skin burns or stings, or if you get an infection. Low-dose steroid cream. Doctors often prescribe it first because it's one of the best treatments. When you have an infection, the medicine to treat it might be mixed with a steroid. But you have to use steroids with care. Thin skin absorbs medicine more easily, so you're more likely to have side effects. A steroid cream can also make your skin even thinner and cause stretch marks or broken blood vessels if you use it too long. Your doctor will likely prescribe a low-dose steroid cream for a short time. Mild vitamin D creams. These have fewer long-term side effects than steroids, and you can use them longer. Sometimes they're mixed with a mild steroid to make them less irritating. Only use the one your doctor prescribes, since not all vitamin D creams work well for sensitive skin. Light treatments (phototherapy). UVB rays in sunlight slow the growth of skin cells and help many kinds of psoriasis. Artificial UVB light works on most parts of the body, but not your genitals. Moisturize. This is a key part of daily care for psoriasis on your whole body, including sensitive areas. A lighter texture is better for delicate skin. Go fragrance- and alcohol-free. Ceramides, lipids, and hyaluronic acid will help replace the natural moisturizers in your skin. Some people swear by oils like olive, coconut, and jojoba, too. Go soapless. Use natural cleansing milks, oils, or balms to wash your face and body instead of soap. If you do use soap, choose one without deodorant. Baby your skin. Creases and folds in your skin can get warm and damp, making them more prone to infection. Dust baby powder or baking soda under your breasts and in your groin to help skin stay cool and dry. Peeling creams. The best products to soften and remove scales have salicylic acid, lactic acid, urea, or phenol. Some over-the counter ( OTC) peels may be too strong, so check with your doctor before you use them. Avoid peels on cracked or bleeding skin. Use an OTC antibiotic that you put on the area to help heal it. A light foundation makeup is often all you need.

"Your skin is thinner and more sensitive in some places, like your face, genitals, and the skin folds under your breasts and buttocks and in your groin. Psoriasis flares here can be more embarrassing, painful, and harder to treat. Some common ways to deal with psoriasis -- like managing your stress, not smoking, putting on moisturizer after a shower or bath, and getting plenty of rest -- are good for these areas, too. But others are too harsh for tender skin. You'll need to consider where your patches are when you make decisions about what to do. Keep these things in mind to protect your sensitive skin and make living with your psoriasis easier. Work closely with your doctor to find a way to control your symptoms. Let him know if anything you put on your skin burns or stings, or if you get an infection. Low-dose steroid cream. Doctors often prescribe it first because it's one of the best treatments. When you have an infection, the medicine to treat it might be mixed with a steroid. But you have to use steroids with care. Thin skin absorbs medicine more easily, so you're more likely to have side effects. A steroid cream can also make your skin even thinner and cause stretch marks or broken blood vessels if you use it too long. Your doctor will likely prescribe a low-dose steroid cream for a short time. Mild vitamin D creams. These have fewer long-term side effects than steroids, and you can use them longer. Sometimes they're mixed with a mild steroid to make them less irritating. Only use the one your doctor prescribes, since not all vitamin D creams work well for sensitive skin. Light treatments (phototherapy). UVB rays in sunlight slow the growth of skin cells and help many kinds of psoriasis. Artificial UVB light works on most parts of the body, but not your genitals. Moisturize. This is a key part of daily care for psoriasis on your whole body, including sensitive areas. A lighter texture is better for delicate skin. Go fragrance- and alcohol-free. Ceramides, lipids, and hyaluronic acid will help replace the natural moisturizers in your skin. Some people swear by oils like olive, coconut, and jojoba, too. Go soapless. Use natural cleansing milks, oils, or balms to wash your face and body instead of soap. If you do use soap, choose one without deodorant. Baby your skin. Creases and folds in your skin can get warm and damp, making them more prone to infection. Dust baby powder or baking soda under your breasts and in your groin to help skin stay cool and dry.

Sometimes they're mixed with a mild steroid to make them less irritating. Only use the one your doctor prescribes, since not all vitamin D creams work well for sensitive skin. Light treatments (phototherapy). UVB rays in sunlight slow the growth of skin cells and help many kinds of psoriasis. Artificial UVB light works on most parts of the body, but not your genitals. Moisturize. This is a key part of daily care for psoriasis on your whole body, including sensitive areas. A lighter texture is better for delicate skin. Go fragrance- and alcohol-free. Ceramides, lipids, and hyaluronic acid will help replace the natural moisturizers in your skin. Some people swear by oils like olive, coconut, and jojoba, too. Go soapless. Use natural cleansing milks, oils, or balms to wash your face and body instead of soap. If you do use soap, choose one without deodorant. Baby your skin. Creases and folds in your skin can get warm and damp, making them more prone to infection. Dust baby powder or baking soda under your breasts and in your groin to help skin stay cool and dry. Peeling creams. The best products to soften and remove scales have salicylic acid, lactic acid, urea, or phenol. Some over-the counter ( OTC) peels may be too strong, so check with your doctor before you use them. Avoid peels on cracked or bleeding skin. Use an OTC antibiotic that you put on the area to help heal it. A light foundation makeup is often all you need. Even when you're trying to cover severe psoriasis, choose a formula specifically meant for your face. Pick something that's not too slippery, so it sticks to your skin, but not so dry that it makes flakes worse. Match your normal skin tone; don't go darker or lighter. You may have better luck finding items at a beauty products store. It might be worth it to have a makeup artist give you some tips about what things to use and how to apply them. For example, many professionals recommend using a primer after your moisturizer and before your foundation to help even out your skin. Since your hair can touch your face and neck, your styling products could be causing irritation. Look for fragrance- and alcohol-free ones. Products with fewer ingredients, that are natural rather than chemical, are safer. Wear loose-fitting clothes and underwear, like boxers or boy shorts. Tight clothes rub on sensitive skin and can make symptoms flare. Choose natural fabrics. Clothes made from cotton or silk are kinder to your skin than synthetics. Avoid scratchy wool. Change your clothes right after exercise so sweat doesn't stay close to your skin and irritate it. Although it may sound like a good idea, workout gear made of ""moisture-wicking"" fabrics might stick to affected skin. Sometimes, especially to the untrained eye, genital psoriasis can look like an STD. Assure your partner that your skin rash isn't contagious. Use non-latex condoms to avoid problems with psoriasis treatments that make latex condoms less effective. You can find them in most supermarkets and pharmacies. Lubricants can make sex more enjoyable for both men and women. Clean your genital area afterward, and apply more medication if you need to. Let your partner know when it's not comfortable to have sex, but don't shut them out. Tell them where you do want to be touched and what feels good to you. Extra pounds can create more skin folds where psoriasis could show up. When you're heavy, you're also more likely to sweat, which can make your symptoms worse.

"Some people are allergic to latex, which is found in rubber gloves and other products, such as condoms and some medical devices. Doctors don't know what causes it. Coming in contact with latex and rubber products over and over may be part of the reason why it happens. About 5% to 10% of health care workers have some form the allergy. Other people who are more likely than most people to get it include those who have: A defect in their bone marrow cells A deformed bladder or urinary tract Had more than one operation A urinary catheter, which has a rubber tip Allergy, asthma, or eczema Food allergies to bananas, avocados, kiwis, or chestnuts Rubber industry workers and people who use condoms are also more likely than others to get a latex allergy. You can get exposed to latex: Through the skin, such as when you wear latex gloves Through mucous membranes, such as the eyes, mouth, vagina, and rectum Through inhalation. Rubber gloves contain a powder that can be inhaled. Through the blood. This can happen when some medical devices containing rubber are used. There are three types of latex reactions: 1. Irritant contact dermatitis . This is the least-threatening type, and it's not an allergic skin reaction. It usually happens due to repeated exposure to chemicals in latex gloves and leads to dryness, itching, burning, scaling, and skin problems. 2. Allergic contact dermatitis . This is a delayed reaction to additives used in latex processing. It results in the same type of reactions as irritant contact dermatitis. But the reaction is more severe, spreads to more parts of the body, and lasts longer. Symptoms can start up to 4 days after you've come in contact with latex. 3. Immediate allergic reaction (latex hypersensitivity). This one is the most serious. It can show up as a nasal allergy with hay fever-like symptoms, conjunctivitis (pink eye), cramps, hives, and severe itching. It's rare, but symptoms may also include rapid heartbeat, tremors, chest pain, trouble breathing, low blood pressure, or anaphylaxis, a severe allergic reaction that can be life-threatening. If you have severe symptoms, call your doctor or 911 immediately, or go to the nearest emergency room. Doctors diagnose a latex allergy in people who: Have had symptoms of an allergic reaction -- like a skin rash, hives, eye tearing or irritation, wheezing, itching, or trouble breathing -- when exposed to latex or a natural rubber product Are known to be at risk for a latex allergy and blood or skin tests show that they have it, even if they haven't had symptoms. If you need a skin test to check on a latex allergy, an allergy specialist must supervise it, in case you have a severe reaction. If the symptoms are irritant contact dermatitis, antihistamine or corticosteroid medicines may be enough to treat the symptoms. If your reaction is severe, you may need epinephrine, IV fluids, and other emergency medical care. If you have a latex allergy, wear a Medic Alertbracelet or another type of ID in case of an emergency. You may also need to carry two epinephrine shots if your doctor recommends that. A allergy to latex can become worse the more you come in contact with it. So if you know you have this condition, be aware of products that may have the potential to cause a reaction. Ask your doctor if you need to avoid them. Many items have latex in them. You may need to ask product makers to be sure. Home goods that are made with latex include: Rubber sink stoppers and sink mats Rubber or rubber-grip utensils Rubber electrical cords or water hoses Bath mats and floor rugs that have rubber backing Toothbrushes with rubber grips or handles Rubber tub toys Sanitary napkins (that contain rubber) Condoms and diaphragms Diapers that contain rubber Adult undergarments that contain rubber Waterproof bed pads containing rubber Undergarments, socks, and other clothing with elastic bands that contain rubber Adhesives such as glue, paste, art supplies, glue pens Older Barbie dolls and other dolls that are made of rubber Rubber bands, mouse and keyboard cords, desktop and chair pads, rubber stamps Mouse and wrist pads containing rubber Keyboards and calculators with rubber keys or switches Pens with comfort grip or any rubber coating Remote controllers for TVs or recording devices with rubber grips or keys Camera, telescope, or binocular eye pieces Bathing caps and elastic in bathing suits Outside the home, latex is also in many items, such as: Grocery store checkout belts Restaurants where workers use latex gloves to prepare food Some balloons Car races that give off tire and rubber particles ATM machine buttons made of rubber Medical products containing latex include: Tourniquets Blood pressure pads EKG pads Some adhesive bandages Dental devices There are many better-bets you can choose instead of latex. These include: Latex Product Alternative Balloons Mylar balloons Baby toys Plastic or cloth toys Bottle nipples Silicone nipples Condoms Sheep cecum condoms (for birth control only) Elastic bands Paper clips, string, or twine Household gloves Synthetic or cotton gloves Raincoat Nylon or synthetic waterproof coats Shoes with rubber Leather or synthetic shoes Telephone cords Clear cords Tell them about your latex allergy at least 24 hours before your appointment. The hospital or doctor's office should have a plan in place so that they can treat you without exposing you to latex. If you have to stay in the hospital, you'll usually be given your own room, free of products that might give you a reaction. Certain ones can trigger a latex-like allergic reaction for some people. They include: Avocado Banana Celery Cherry Chestnut Fig Grape Hazelnut Kiwi Melon Nectarine Papaya Peach Pineapple Plum Potato Rye Tomato Wheat",Who is likely to get a latex allergy?,False,"['Other people who are more likely than most people to get it include those who have: A defect in their bone marrow cells A deformed bladder or urinary tract Had more than one operation A urinary catheter, which has a rubber tip Allergy, asthma, or eczema Food allergies to bananas, avocados, kiwis, or chestnuts Rubber industry workers and people who use condoms are also more likely than others to get a latex allergy.']"
"If you're looking for a natural remedy to add to your psoriasis treatment plan, coconut oil gets a lot of buzz. There's not a lot of research on whether that's truth or hype, but there are reasons to think it might be another tool for your toolkit. Coconut oil comes from the fruit -- white part -- of a coconut. You can cook and bake with it. And many people use it on their hair and nails as a natural beauty product. It has two forms: refined and unrefined or virgin. Refined coconut oil comes from dried coconut. The oil is taken out under high heat and then goes through a bleaching and deodorizing process. It doesn't smell like coconut -- it has a neutral odor. In the kitchen, you can use it for sautÃ©ing, stir-frying, and baking. Unrefined coconut oil comes from fresh coconut fruit. The process doesn't involve high temperatures, which is why you might see it called ""cold-pressed."" Virgin coconut oil smells like coconuts. You can use it to bake and cook, just like refined coconut oil, but it's best for dishes cooked at lower temperatures. Virgin cold-pressed coconut oil ( VCO) is the kind experts think has the most health benefits, both as part of your diet and for your skin. Because VCO isn't processed with high heat, it keeps more of its germ-fighting power than refined coconut oil. It can: Moisturize Help with inflammation Kill bacteria When you put VCO on your skin, it can help hold in moisture, ease redness and swelling, and keep certain bacteria from growing. Studies show VCO can help with symptoms of eczema (atopic dermatitis), a skin condition that looks a lot like psoriasis. Eczema and psoriasis share many of the same symptoms and even have some of the same triggers. Psoriasis scales tend to be thicker than patches of eczema, but both need moisturizing treatment to help with dryness, scaling, and itching. So even though they're different conditions, VCO can help with both. While it may be a good add-on to your psoriasis treatment plan, coconut oil isn't a stand-alone solution. For psoriasis medications like steroids to work well, it's best to soften the hard scales so the meds can get to the skin below. Coconut oil can help soften and loosen the scales first. Scalp psoriasis tends to have the hardest scales because your hair traps them in place and they're not easy to see or treat. They can get bigger and tougher over time. Here's how to use coconut oil to help with the scales on your scalp: Spread the oil over your scalp, focusing on scaly areas. Gently massage the oil into the scales. Wrap your scalp in a towel or shower cap. Leave it on for 30 to 60 minutes, or overnight. Wash your hair and scalp with normal, anti-dandruff, or tar shampoo. After treating with VCO, it should be easier to loosen and remove some scales gently. Do it while your scalp is still damp and the scales are the softest and loose. Then: Put a plastic comb flat against the scale and gently rub it in a circle. As the scale loosens, try to comb it out of your hair. Wash your hair to remove any leftover scales. Don't pull too hard or too quickly. Doing so can hurt your skin, cause bleeding, or make you lose hair. After you've taken the scaly layer off, apply your prescription treatment.",How does coconut oil treat psoriasis symptoms?,False,"[""It can: Moisturize Help with inflammation Kill bacteria When you put VCO on your skin, it can help hold in moisture, ease redness and swelling, and keep certain bacteria from growing.

"If you have scalp psoriasis, the itchy, painful scales may keep you awake at night. Nearly half the people who have it also have sleep problems. Luckily, there are easy ways to get more rest. Moisture can soothe your scalp and calm the itch. Take a warm shower before you go to sleep every night. Wash your hair each time. Try an over-the-counter shampoo for people with psoriasis. Look for one with tar, ketoconazole, or salicylic acid. Dandruff shampoo may also help. To give it time to work, leave it on your scalp for 5 minutes before you rinse it out. If your doctor gave you a cream or other medicine to use during your shower, put it on your wet scalp before you shampoo. Leave it on for the prescribed period of time, then wash and rinse as usual.

"Psoriasis turns your skin cells into type A overachievers: They grow about five times faster than normal skin cells. And your body can't keep up. The old ones pile up instead of sloughing off, making thick, flaky, itchy patches. Why do these cells go a little haywire? There's more going on under the surface of this skin disease. Researchers think something sets off your immune system. The exact reason is a mystery. But it's likely a combination of genetics and triggers. Little bits of your DNA, called genes, are instructions for your cells. They control things like your eye and hair color, if you can taste certain things, and other ways your body works. Some genes are only active at certain times. When you have psoriasis, the genes that control your immune system signals get mixed up. Instead of protecting your body from invaders as it's designed to do, it promotes inflammation and turns skin cells on overdrive. Scientists have found about 25 genes that are different in people with psoriasis. They think it takes more than one to cause the disease, and they're looking for the main ones. About 10 in every 100 people have genes that make them more likely to get psoriasis, but only two or three of them actually do. The disease often shows up or flares during puberty. Menopause can also trigger it. During pregnancy, your symptoms may get better or even go away. But after the baby's born, you might have a flare. Heavy drinkers have a higher risk, especially younger men. Alcohol can make treatments less effective, too. Lighting up can double your risk of getting psoriasis. If you also have relatives with the disease, you're nine times more likely to get it. And smoking makes it harder to get rid of symptoms. It's closely linked with a hard-to-treat type called pustular psoriasis, which affects the palms of your hands and the soles of your feet. Scientists think your immune system may respond to emotional and mental pressures the same way it does to physical problems like injuries and infections. Some treatments can make psoriasis worse. These include: Lithium, which treats bipolar disorder and other mental illnesses High blood pressure and heart medicines, including propranolol ( Inderal) and other beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors, and quinidine Antimalarial medicines, including chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine ( Plaquenil), and quinacrine Indomethacin ( Indocin), which treats inflammation Psoriasis usually is worse in the beginning stages of HIV infection, but then it gets better after you start certain treatments. Strep infections, in particular, are linked with guttate psoriasis, which looks like small, red drops. Kids will often have strep throat before their first flare. Earaches, bronchitis, tonsillitis, or a respiratory infection such as a cold, the flu, or skin problems. A little natural sunlight is good for most people with psoriasis. But for a few, the sun makes their condition worse. So can a bad sunburn, so protect your skin if you're going to be outside. A cut, scrape, bug bite, infection, or too much scratching can trigger the condition. People who are obese tend to get plaques in their skin creases and folds. Your psoriasis might be worse in the winter. Dry air, less natural sunlight, and cold temperatures can make symptoms worse.

"Almost always, your skin will itch before a rash appears in eczema. Typically, eczema shows itself as: Patches of chronically itchy, dry, thickened skin, usually on the hands, neck, face, and legs (but it can occur anywhere). In children, the inner creases of the knees and elbows are often involved. If scratched, dry patches of skin and open sores with crusts may develop and may get infected. You develop an itchy rash and have a family history of eczema or asthma. The inflammation doesn't respond within a week to treatment with over-the-counter hydrocortisone creams. You may need more aggressive forms of treatment. You develop yellowish to light brown crust or pus-filled blisters over existing patches of eczema. This may indicate a bacterial infection that should be treated with an antibiotic. During a flare-up of eczema, you are exposed to anyone with a viral skin disease such as cold sores or genital herpes. Having eczema puts you at increased risk of contracting the herpes simplex virus. You develop numerous painful, small, fluid-filled blisters in the areas of eczema.

Testosterone belongs to a class of male hormones called androgens. But women also have testosterone. The ovaries produce both testosterone and estrogen. Relatively small quantities of testosterone are released into your bloodstream by the ovaries and adrenal glands. In addition to being produced by the ovaries, estrogen is also produced by the body's fat tissue. These sex hormones are involved in the growth, maintenance, and repair of reproductive tissues. But that's not all. They also influence other body tissues and bone mass. A hormone is a chemical substance. It's secreted by one tissue and travels by way of body fluids to affect another tissue in your body. In essence, hormones are ""chemical messengers."" Many hormones, especially those affecting growth and behavior, are significant to both men and women. The amount and levels of hormones change daily. The sex hormones, estrogen and testosterone, are secreted in short bursts -- pulses -- which vary from hour to hour and even minute to minute. Hormone release varies between night and day and from one stage of the menstrual cycle to another. Estrogen is an entire class of related hormones that includes estriol, estradiol, and estrone. Estriol is made from the placenta. It's produced during pregnancy. Estradiol is the primary sex hormone of childbearing women. It is formed from developing ovarian follicles. Estradiol is responsible for female characteristics and sexual functioning. Also, estradiol is important to women's bone health. Estradiol contributes to most gynecologic problems, including endometriosis and fibroids and even female cancers. Estrone is widespread throughout the body. It is the main estrogen present after menopause. There are many reasons why estrogen levels fall, including: Hypogonadism Hypopituitarism Pregnancy failure (estriol) Perimenopause and menopause (estradiol) Polycystic ovarian syndrome ( PCOS) Anorexia nervosa (eating disorder) Extreme exercise or training Drugs that block estrogen include clomiphene, which tricks the body into thinking it has decreased levels of estrogen. Also, women experience low levels of estrogen immediately after childbirth and also during breastfeeding. Women with low body fat often do not produce sufficient amounts of sex hormones. This can be a problem for women such as athletes, models, and gymnasts. It can also be a problem for women with eating disorders. These women can experience a cessation of menstruation, known as amenorrhea. They may also develop osteoporosis -- thin bones -- and fractures as well as other conditions more common in older women after menopause. Yes. Estrogen levels fall at menopause. This is a natural transition for all women between ages 40 and 55. The decline in estrogen can happen abruptly in younger women whose ovaries are removed, resulting in so-called surgical menopause. Perimenopause is the period of transition before menopause. The first natural decline in estrogen levels starts during this phase. Other physiological changes also start. Women going through perimenopause may experience weight gain along with other menopause symptoms. For instance, there may be irregular menstrual periods, hot flashes, and vaginal dryness. On average, menopause occurs at age 51. When it does, a woman's body produces less estrogen and progesterone. The drop of estrogen levels at menopause can cause uncomfortable symptoms, including: Hot flashes Night sweats Vaginal dryness or itching Loss of libido or sex drive Some women experience moodiness. That may or may not be related to the loss of estrogen. Lower levels of estrogen may also increase a woman's risk for heart disease, stroke, osteoporosis and fractures. During puberty, it's normal for levels of estrogen to rise. That's because this hormone fuels changes in a young girl's body. For example, it plays a role in the development of breasts, a more mature curved figure, fuller hips, and pubic and underarm hair. In addition, high levels of estrogen are seen in women who are extremely overweight. Estrogen levels rise during a healthy pregnancy, and increased estrogen levels may be seen with tumors of the ovaries, testes, or adrenal glands. Some drugs, such as steroid medications, ampicillin, estrogen-containing drugs, phenothiazines, and tetracyclines can increase estrogen levels. If your body produces too much testosterone, you may have irregular or absent menstrual periods. You may also have more body hair than the average woman. Some women with high testosterone levels develop frontal balding. Other possible effects include acne, an enlarged clitoris, increased muscle mass, and deepening of voice. High levels of testosterone can also lead to infertility and are commonly seen in polycystic ovarian syndrome ( PCOS). PCOS is an endocrine condition that is sometimes seen in women of childbearing age who have difficulty getting pregnant. Women with PCOS have symptoms similar to those produced by high testosterone levels. They include: Obesity An apple-shaped body Excessive or thinning hair Acne Menstrual irregularity PCOS is associated with: Higher levels of circulating male hormones Insulin resistance Carbohydrate intolerance -- conditions that make you prone to gaining weight Low levels of HDL -- ''good'' -- cholesterol Elevated triglycerides High LDL -- ''bad'' -- cholesterol Obesity High blood pressure As women with PCOS age, the presence of these risk factors increases their risk for heart disease. At menopause, women experience a decline in testosterone. That decline may be correlated to a reduced libido. Some findings indicate that testosterone replacement therapy may benefit sexual function in certain perimenopausal and postmenopausal women. Testosterone replacement is unadvised in women with breast or uterine cancer. It also may increase the chances of cardiovascular disease or liver disease. So, experts are cautious about recommendations. Your doctor can do a physical examination and assess your health situation and symptoms to determine if further laboratory tests are needed to check hormone levels. Those tests may be important if you have a health condition such as PCOS or have stopped menstruating because of excessive athletic training or anorexia nervosa. If the tests show abnormal levels of hormones, your doctor can prescribe effective treatment.",What happens when testosterone levels rise in women?,False,"['If your body produces too much testosterone, you may have irregular or absent menstrual periods.

Testosterone belongs to a class of male hormones called androgens. But women also have testosterone. The ovaries produce both testosterone and estrogen. Relatively small quantities of testosterone are released into your bloodstream by the ovaries and adrenal glands. In addition to being produced by the ovaries, estrogen is also produced by the body's fat tissue. These sex hormones are involved in the growth, maintenance, and repair of reproductive tissues. But that's not all. They also influence other body tissues and bone mass. A hormone is a chemical substance. It's secreted by one tissue and travels by way of body fluids to affect another tissue in your body. In essence, hormones are ""chemical messengers."" Many hormones, especially those affecting growth and behavior, are significant to both men and women. The amount and levels of hormones change daily. The sex hormones, estrogen and testosterone, are secreted in short bursts -- pulses -- which vary from hour to hour and even minute to minute. Hormone release varies between night and day and from one stage of the menstrual cycle to another. Estrogen is an entire class of related hormones that includes estriol, estradiol, and estrone. Estriol is made from the placenta. It's produced during pregnancy. Estradiol is the primary sex hormone of childbearing women. It is formed from developing ovarian follicles. Estradiol is responsible for female characteristics and sexual functioning. Also, estradiol is important to women's bone health. Estradiol contributes to most gynecologic problems, including endometriosis and fibroids and even female cancers. Estrone is widespread throughout the body.

But the different types of eczema tend to cause these symptoms: Itching . The itching can be intense. The damage to the skin during eczema is often due to scratching. Scaling. The surface of the skin can flake off, giving the skin a rough, scaly appearance. Redness. The affected skin may bleed and appear blotchy. Fluid-filled blisters. These can ooze and form crusts. Cracking. Severely affected skin may develop painful, deep cracks, also called fissures. Depending on the cause, eczema may flare up and cause severe symptoms. But it can also become a chronic problem with less intense symptoms. Here's a look at the types of eczema and their treatments. Atopic dermatitis is the most common form of eczema. It often affects people who also have: Asthma or hay fever Family history of eczema, asthma, or hay fever Defects in the skin barrier, allowing moisture out and germs in Atopic dermatitis usually begins during infancy or childhood. But it can strike people at any age. Most often, it affects skin on the: Face Hands Feet Inner elbows Back of the knees Over time, scratching the skin can cause it to become thick and red. Scratching can also create wounds that become infected. Irritants that can make symptoms of atopic dermatitis worse include: Soap Rough clothing Household chemicals Foods, dust mites, and other allergy triggers can also make symptoms worse. Treatments for atopic dermatitis include: Products to lubricate and moisturize the skin Steroid creams and ointments Drugs that control the immune system including dupilumab ( Dupixent), which is given as an injection every two weeks, and crisaborole ( Eucrisa), a non-steroidal ointment that is used topically twice a day. Antibiotics to treat infections Ultraviolet light, alone or with a drug called psoralen There are two types of contact dermatitis: Irritant contact dermatitis Allergic contact dermatitis These types of eczema can develop after a substance damages the skin. These include chemicals and frequent hand washing. Irritant contact dermatitis can develop after touching a strong irritant one time or by coming into contact with the irritating substance repeatedly. Contact dermatitis can also develop after a person touches an allergy-triggering substance, such as: Nickel Cosmetics Poison ivy The hands are especially vulnerable to developing contact dermatitis. People can develop contact dermatitis even if they don't have atopic dermatitis. Treatments for irritant contact dermatitis include: Moisturizers for the skin Steroid medications Treatments for contact dermatitis from allergic triggers also include steroid drugs. These are rubbed on the skin or taken as a pill. For either type of contact dermatitis, antibiotics may be necessary. Avoiding future contact with the irritant or allergy trigger is also important. Wearing gloves can help protect the skin on the hands, which are often affected. This type of eczema affects the hands and feet. The cause is unknown. The first symptom may be severe itching. Blisters may then appear, which give way a few weeks later to scaly patches. Sometimes deep cracks can appear on the hands or fingers. This type of eczema may become chronic and painful. Treatments include: Cool, wet compresses Steroid drugs that are rubbed onto the skin or taken by mouth Psoralen combined with ultraviolet A therapy This type of eczema more often affects men than women. Men usually don't get their first outbreak before their mid-50s. Women tend to get it in their teen years or early adulthood. Nummular dermatitis causes coin-shaped red marks. The marks appear most often on the: Legs Backs of the hands Forearms Lower back Hips The cause of nummular dermatitis is unknown. However, factors that may raise the chance that an outbreak will strike include: Cold, dry air Exposure to chemicals such as formaldehyde Exposure to metals, including nickel Treatments for nummular dermatitis include: Protecting your skin from scratches and other injuries Taking a lukewarm bath or shower, then applying a moisturizer to your skin Applying a steroid ointment to the rash Taking a steroid medication by mouth or injection that goes to work throughout your body Taking antibiotics if an infection develops People with this type of eczema develop skin irritation in spots that they frequently scratch out of habit. This type of eczema often affects these areas: Back Sides or back of the neck Genitals Scalp Wrists Ankles Inside and behind the ear People may scratch affected areas during the day without realizing it. They may also scratch while asleep. Usually, neurodermatitis causes a skin outbreak that doesn't get any bigger. But the irritated skin can grow thick and deeply wrinkled. Infections may also develop in the irritated areas. The main treatment for this type of eczema is to stop scratching it. In the meantime, steroid medicines that are rubbed onto the skin can help treat symptoms. When neurodermatitis affects the scalp, it can be harder to treat. In these cases, it may require the steroid medication prednisone, which is taken by mouth. This type of eczema is better known as dandruff. In infants, it affects the scalp. In adults, it also often affects these areas: Eyebrows Sides of the nose Area behind the ears Groin Center of chest Seborrheic dermatitis causes skin to fall off in flakes.

But it can strike people at any age. Most often, it affects skin on the: Face Hands Feet Inner elbows Back of the knees Over time, scratching the skin can cause it to become thick and red. Scratching can also create wounds that become infected. Irritants that can make symptoms of atopic dermatitis worse include: Soap Rough clothing Household chemicals Foods, dust mites, and other allergy triggers can also make symptoms worse. Treatments for atopic dermatitis include: Products to lubricate and moisturize the skin Steroid creams and ointments Drugs that control the immune system including dupilumab ( Dupixent), which is given as an injection every two weeks, and crisaborole ( Eucrisa), a non-steroidal ointment that is used topically twice a day. Antibiotics to treat infections Ultraviolet light, alone or with a drug called psoralen There are two types of contact dermatitis: Irritant contact dermatitis Allergic contact dermatitis These types of eczema can develop after a substance damages the skin. These include chemicals and frequent hand washing. Irritant contact dermatitis can develop after touching a strong irritant one time or by coming into contact with the irritating substance repeatedly. Contact dermatitis can also develop after a person touches an allergy-triggering substance, such as: Nickel Cosmetics Poison ivy The hands are especially vulnerable to developing contact dermatitis. People can develop contact dermatitis even if they don't have atopic dermatitis. Treatments for irritant contact dermatitis include: Moisturizers for the skin Steroid medications Treatments for contact dermatitis from allergic triggers also include steroid drugs. These are rubbed on the skin or taken as a pill. For either type of contact dermatitis, antibiotics may be necessary. Avoiding future contact with the irritant or allergy trigger is also important. Wearing gloves can help protect the skin on the hands, which are often affected. This type of eczema affects the hands and feet. The cause is unknown. The first symptom may be severe itching. Blisters may then appear, which give way a few weeks later to scaly patches. Sometimes deep cracks can appear on the hands or fingers. This type of eczema may become chronic and painful. Treatments include: Cool, wet compresses Steroid drugs that are rubbed onto the skin or taken by mouth Psoralen combined with ultraviolet A therapy This type of eczema more often affects men than women. Men usually don't get their first outbreak before their mid-50s. Women tend to get it in their teen years or early adulthood. Nummular dermatitis causes coin-shaped red marks. The marks appear most often on the: Legs Backs of the hands Forearms Lower back Hips The cause of nummular dermatitis is unknown. However, factors that may raise the chance that an outbreak will strike include: Cold, dry air Exposure to chemicals such as formaldehyde Exposure to metals, including nickel Treatments for nummular dermatitis include: Protecting your skin from scratches and other injuries Taking a lukewarm bath or shower, then applying a moisturizer to your skin Applying a steroid ointment to the rash Taking a steroid medication by mouth or injection that goes to work throughout your body Taking antibiotics if an infection develops People with this type of eczema develop skin irritation in spots that they frequently scratch out of habit. This type of eczema often affects these areas: Back Sides or back of the neck Genitals Scalp Wrists Ankles Inside and behind the ear People may scratch affected areas during the day without realizing it. They may also scratch while asleep. Usually, neurodermatitis causes a skin outbreak that doesn't get any bigger. But the irritated skin can grow thick and deeply wrinkled. Infections may also develop in the irritated areas. The main treatment for this type of eczema is to stop scratching it. In the meantime, steroid medicines that are rubbed onto the skin can help treat symptoms. When neurodermatitis affects the scalp, it can be harder to treat. In these cases, it may require the steroid medication prednisone, which is taken by mouth. This type of eczema is better known as dandruff. In infants, it affects the scalp. In adults, it also often affects these areas: Eyebrows Sides of the nose Area behind the ears Groin Center of chest Seborrheic dermatitis causes skin to fall off in flakes. The condition may be due to an overgrowth of a type of yeast that normally lives in these areas, as well as an overgrowth and rapid shedding of cells on the scalp. It may be especially hard to treat in people whose immune systems aren't working properly, including people with AIDS . Treatments vary between infants and people with the condition later in life. The treatments include: Shampoo containing salicylic acid, selenium sulfide, zinc pyrithione, or coal tar Antifungal treatments that are rubbed onto affected areas Steroid lotions This type of eczema can develop in people when the veins in their lower legs don't properly return blood to their heart. Stasis dermatitis can arise quickly, causing weeping and crusting of the skin. Over time, this type of eczema can cause the skin to develop brown stains.

"Juvenile arthritis is a disease in which there is inflammation (swelling) of the synovium in children aged 16 or younger. The synovium is the tissue that lines the inside of joints. Juvenile arthritis is an autoimmune disease. That means the immune system, which normally protects the body from foreign substances, attacks the body instead. The disease is also idiopathic, which means that no exact cause is known. Researchers believe juvenile arthritis may be related to genetics, certain infections, and environmental triggers. There are five types of juvenile arthritis: Systemic arthritis, also called Still's disease, can affect the entire body or involve many systems of the body. Systemic juvenile arthritis usually causes high fever and a rash. The rash is usually on the trunk, arms, and legs. Systemic juvenile arthritis can also affect internal organs, such as the heart, liver, spleen, and lymph nodes, but usually not the eyes. Boys and girls are equally affected. Oligoarthritis, also called pauciarticular juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, affects fewer than five joints in the first six months that the child has the disease. The joints most commonly affected are the knee, ankle, and wrist. Oligoarthritis can affect the eye, most often the iris. This is known as uveitis, iridocyclitis, or iritis. This type of arthritis is more common in girls than in boys, and many children will outgrow this disease by the time they become adults. Polyarthritis, also called polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (p JIA), involves five or more joints in the first six months of the disease -- often the same joints on each side of the body. This type of arthritis can affect the joints in the jaw and neck as well as those in the hands and feet. This type also is also more common in girls than in boys and more closely resembles the adult form. Psoriatic arthritis affects children who have both arthritis and the skin disorder psoriasis. The child might get either the psoriasis or the arthritis years before developing the other part of the disease. Children with this type of arthritis often have pitted fingernails. Enthesitis-related arthritis is a type of arthritis that often afflicts the spine, hips, eyes, and entheses (the places where tendons attach to bones). This type of arthritis occurs mainly in boys older than 8 years of age. There is often a family history of arthritis of the back (called ankylosing spondylitis) among the child's male relatives. Children with juvenile arthritis can have no symptoms at all. Symptoms may also vary depending on the type of arthritis. Symptoms of juvenile arthritis may include: Joint stiffness, especially in the morning Pain, swelling, and tenderness in the joints Limping ( In younger children, it may appear that the child is not able to perform motor skills he or she recently learned.) Persistent fever Rash Weight loss Fatigue Irritability Eye redness or eye pain Blurred vision Because a child may have no symptoms of juvenile arthritis, and because some of the symptoms can be associated with other diseases, a diagnosis may be difficult. Because there is no actual test for juvenile arthritis, the diagnosis is made by excluding other conditions that may cause similar symptoms, such as bone disorders or breaks, fibromyalgia, infection, Lyme disease, lupus, or cancer. The doctor is likely to begin by taking a complete medical history and performing a complete medical exam. Additional testing might be useful in determining what type of arthritis the child has. Some of the other tests that might be ordered include: Complete blood count (white cells, red cells, and platelets) Lab tests on blood or urine X-rays (to rule out breaks or damage to bones) Imaging tests, such as magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI) scans Blood culture to check for bacteria, which could indicate an infection in the bloodstream Tests for viruses Tests for Lyme disease Bone marrow exam, which is used to check for leukemia Erythrocyte sedimentation rate to see how quickly the red blood cells fall to the bottom of a test tube ( The rate is faster in most people who have a disease that causes inflammation.) Test for rheumatoid factor, an antibody that may be found in people with arthritis ( An abnormal result is more common in adults than in children.) Antinuclear antibody test to show evidence of autoimmunity ( Autoimmunity is a disease state in which the body's defense system, the immune system, malfunctions and attacks the body itself. This test is also useful in predicting if eye disease will develop in children with juvenile arthritis.) Bone scan to detect changes in bones and joints ( This test may be ordered if the symptoms include unexplained pain in the joints and bone.) Joint fluid sampling and synovial tissue sampling, which might be performed by an orthopedic surgeon Treatment for juvenile arthritis generally includes both exercise and medications. The treatment plans are also based on the type of juvenile arthritis. For instance, children who have polyarticular juvenile arthritis and who have a positive result on the rheumatoid factor test have the potential for more joint damage and may need more aggressive treatment. In general, though, treatment for juvenile arthritis has several main goals: To relieve pain To reduce swelling To increase joint mobility and strength To prevent joint damage and complications The following types of drugs may be used to treat juvenile arthritis: Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs) are used to treat pain and swelling. There are NSAIDs available over the counter and others that are prescription only. NSAIDs include products such as ibuprofen and naproxen. Possible side effects are nausea and stomach ache; these drugs should be taken with food. Aspirin is included in the NSAID category, but is rarely prescribed for treating arthritis. Slow-acting anti-rheumatic drugs ( SAARDs) are used to treat pain and swelling over time and usually take several weeks or more to work. These drugs are also called disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs ( DMARDs). The doctor may prescribe drugs in this category in combination with NSAIDs. Lab tests to check for possible side effects are usually necessary. One of the most commonly used DMARDs is methotrexate ( Rheumatrex). Other DMARDs include hydroxychloroquine ( Plaquenil), sulfasalazine ( Azulfidine), and drugs that block tumor necrosis factor ( TNF), also called anti- TNF drugs. Etanercept ( Enbrel) and etanercept-szzs ( Erelzi) are examples of anti- TNF medication used to treat juvenile arthritis. Corticosteroids are also used to treat pain and swelling. Sometimes, before any other treatment is tried, steroids are given as an injection into the affected joint. In certain cases, the doctor might prescribe oral steroids (taken by mouth), but these are generally avoided in children because of adverse side effects, which may include poor growth and weight gain. Antimetabolites are a type of drug that is an aggressive therapy aimed at helping reduce further joint damage and preserve joint function. The new drug Xatmep is an oral form of methotrexate that can be used to treat polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis in pediatric patients, usually when NSAIDs have been proven to be ineffective.",What is psoriatic juvenile arthritis?,False,['Psoriatic arthritis affects children who have both arthritis and the skin disorder psoriasis.
