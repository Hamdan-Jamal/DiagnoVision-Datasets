"Guttate psoriasis is a type of psoriasis that shows up on your skin as red, scaly, small, teardrop-shaped spots. It doesn't normally leave a scar. You usually get it as a child or young adult. Less than a third of people with psoriasis have this type. It's not as common as plaque psoriasis. It's an autoimmune disease, meaning your body treats your own cells like invaders and attacks them. You might get it only once, or you could have several flare-ups. In some cases, this type of psoriasis doesn't go away. With the help of your doctor, you can find a treatment to keep your symptoms under control. The spots you get from guttate psoriasis aren't as thick as the ones from plaque psoriasis. You can sometimes have both kinds of psoriasis at once. You probably would get them on your arms, legs, stomach, and chest. It can sometimes spread from there to your face, ears, and scalp. But it doesn't show up on your palms, the soles of your feet, or nails like other forms of psoriasis can. You're more likely to have a flare-up during the winter, when the air is dry. Your symptoms may clear up more quickly in summer. There are three: Mild. Only a few spots cover about 3% of your skin. Moderate. Lesions cover about 3%-10% of your skin. Severe. Lesions cover 10% or more of your body and could cover your entire body. The stage can also be based on how much they interfere with your daily life and activities. For example, psoriasis on your face or scalp can affect only 2%-3% of your total body surface area, but it could be classified as severe because it affects your appearance and livelihood. Psoriasis on your hands might only cover 2% total body surface area, but could affect your livelihood if you work with your hands. In that case it would be classified as moderate to severe. An outbreak is usually triggered by a bacterial infection -- typically streptococcus (strep throat). It sets off an immune system reaction that causes the spots on your skin. In some cases, guttate psoriasis is genetic. If someone in your family has it, your chances of getting it go up. Other triggers include: Upper respiratory infections Tonsillitis Stress Cuts, burns, or bites on your skin Some drugs you take (antimalarials and beta-blockers) Your doctor will want to know your medical history, especially what kinds of medications you may be taking. She'll look at your skin. Usually, a physical exam gives your doctor enough information to diagnose or rule out guttate psoriasis. If she needs more information, your doctor may take a blood sample or a throat culture to check for strep. It's also common for doctors to perform a skin biopsy when they want to know for sure what you have. In most cases an outbreak of guttate psoriasis lasts 2 to 3 weeks. But your doctor may want to treat your symptoms and help prevent other infections in your body. Medications. There are several over-the-counter or prescription options for the itchy, flaky skin, as well as the dryness and swelling. They include: Cortisone cream for itching and swelling Dandruff shampoo for your scalp Lotions with coal tar to soothe your skin Moisturizers Prescription medicines with or vitamin AIf your case is more serious, your doctor may give you a prescription to take by mouth. These include: Corticosteroids Methotrexate Apremilast ( Otezla) Phototherapy. Also known as light therapy, this is another option.

"If you have thrombocytopenia, you don't have enough platelets in your blood. Platelets help your blood clot, which stops bleeding. For most people, it's not a big problem. But if you have a severe form, you can bleed spontaneously in your eyes, gums, or bladder or bleed too much when you're injured. A healthy person usually has a platelet count of 150,000 to 400,000. You have thrombocytopenia if your number falls under 150,000. If you're wondering what the long name means, here's how it breaks down: "" Thrombocytes"" are your platelets, and ""penia"" means you don't have enough of something. Put those terms together, and you get ""thrombocytopenia."" Thrombocytopenia has many causes. One of the most common causes of low platelets is a condition called immune thrombocytopenia ( ITP). You may hear it called by its old name, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura. Although doctors don't know what causes ITP, they know that it happens when your immune system -- your body's main defense against disease -- doesn't work right. Your antibodies, which are supposed to attack infections, instead mistakenly destroy your platelets. Thrombocytopenia can run in families, but you can also get it from many medical conditions. Treating the medical condition may improve ITP. If your thrombocytopenia is not due to ITP, your body might have fewer platelets because of these causes: Viral infections (including chickenpox, parvovirus, hepatitis C, Epstein- Barr, and HIV) Systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE) Chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL) Drug-induced immune thrombocytopenia Sepsis, a severe bacterial infection in your blood Helicobacter pylori ( H. pylori), a bacteria that can live in your digestive system Medicines Medication side effects, including drugs for heart problems, seizures, and infections Heparin, a blood thinner used to prevent blood clots Chemotherapy Work with your doctor to figure out if a drug is causing your platelet count to drop. He may be able to adjust your dose or change your medication. Other Treatments Heart bypass surgery Radiation treatment on your bone marrow Medical Conditions Blood cancer such as leukemia or lymphoma A problem with your bone marrow, like toxicity from drinking too much alcohol Vitamin B12 or folate (vitamin B9) deficiency Pregnancy. Up to 5% of healthy women get it during pregnancy, and it usually gets better on its own after your baby is born. But it can also be a sign of something more concerning, like preeclampsia or HELLP syndrome. An enlarged spleen Your body uses too many platelets, leaving you without enough of them. That can happen if you have an autoimmune disease like rheumatoid arthritis or lupus. Rare disorders like hemolytic uremic syndrome and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura ( TTP), which uses a lot of platelets to make small blood clots throughout your body Usually, thrombocytopenia has no symptoms. But when you do have them, they can include: Bleeding, most often from the gums or nose. Women with thrombocytopenia may have heavier or longer periods or breakthrough bleeding. You may also see blood in your pee or poop. Red, flat spots on your skin, about the size of a pinhead. You see these mostly on your legs and feet, and they may appear in clumps. Your doctor may call them petechiae. Blotches and bruises. You might have large areas of bleeding under the skin that don't turn white when you press on them. You also might see what look like the bruises you get from a bump or being hit. They could be blue or purple and change to yellow or green over time. These are caused from the inside, by the sudden leaking from tiny blood vessels. The medical name for these is purpura. Severe thrombocytopenia can cause a lot of bleeding after an injury, such as a fall. Thrombocytopenia is often found by chance when your doctor does a routine blood test. They might ask you: What symptoms (including bleeding) have you noticed? When did you first see them? Does anything make them better? Or worse? What medications and supplements are you taking? Have you had any shots in the last month, a blood transfusion, or used drugs with a needle? Does anyone in your family have a problem with their immune system, bleeding, or bruising? What have you eaten recently? Your doctor may do a physical exam to check you for signs of bleeding and feel if your spleen seems big. Some tests check for low platelet levels: CBC (complete blood count). This measures the amount of your red and white blood cells and platelets. Blood smear. This shows how your platelets look under a microscope. Bone marrow test. Your doctor uses a very fine needle to draw a small amount of liquid bone marrow and check it for cells that may not be working right. Or you may get a biopsy, using a different kind of needle, so your doctor can check the types and numbers of cells in the bone marrow. You may need more tests to help your doctor figure out what's going on. What's causing the problem? What are my treatment options? Which do you recommend? Do these treatments have side effects? What can I do about them? How will we know if the treatment is working? When will I start to feel better? What do you expect for my case? Does this condition put me at risk for anything else? Do I need to see a specialist? There are a lot of treatment options for thrombocytopenia and ITP. You'll need to work with your doctor to weigh the pros and cons of each and find a therapy that's right for you. If you have ITP, your treatment depends on how severe a case you have. If it's mild, you may only need to get regular checks of your platelet levels. When you do need treatment, the goal is to get your platelet count to a level that's high enough to prevent serious bleeding in the gut or brain. Your doctor will likely suggest these treatments for ITP first: Corticosteroids. Dexamethasone or prednisone is typically prescribed to raise your platelet count. You take it once a day in the form of a pill or tablet. An increased or normalized platelet count is generally seen within 2 weeks of therapy, particularly with high-dose dexamethasone. Your doctor will then likely cut your dose gradually over the next 4 to 8 weeks. The treatment may have to be repeated, but once your platelet count is normal, none is needed again. There are some side effects to prednisone, especially if you use it for a long time. Even after a short time, you can get irritable, have stomach upsets, and have other problems such as: Sleep problems Weight gain Puffy cheeks Peeing a lot Lower bone density Acne Besides side effects, another disadvantage to prednisone is that your platelet count may drop once you've finished your treatment. IVIG (intravenous immune globulin). If you can't get your platelet count up with prednisone, if you cannot tolerate steroids, or if your count drops after you're done with your treatment, your doctor may suggest IVIG. You take this medication through an IV, usually for several hours a day for 1 to 5 days. The advantage of IVIG is that it can raise your platelet count quickly. But the increase in platelets is only temporary. It is useful for people who need to get their levels boosted fast or who cannot tolerate steroids. The side effects include: Nausea and vomiting Headaches Fever and chills Surgery. If you have ITP and other treatments haven't raised your platelet levels enough, you may benefit from an operation to remove your spleen. That's the organ that destroys your platelets, so taking it out can give your platelet count a boost. But this doesn't always work. Getting your spleen removed can make it harder for you to fight infections. Your infection risk is greatest in the first 3 months after your surgery. Rituximab ( Rituxan). This drug is a type of treatment known as biologic therapy. It attacks B cells, a type of white blood cell that can destroy platelets. It's sometimes used if you have severe ITP despite treatment with steroids and you aren't able to have surgery to remove your spleen. Your doctor may also suggest it if you've had your spleen removed but you still have low platelet counts. Side effects for rituximab include: Fever Chills Weakness Nausea Headaches Weakened immune system Rho( D) immune globulin. This treatment, which you also take through an IV, is an alternative to traditional IVIG in people who have Rh+ blood. It generally takes less than half an hour. The side effects are similar to IVIG. If corticosteroids, IVIG, and Rho( D) aren't improving your platelet count and you're having bleeding problems, your doctor may switch to a second set of options. There are pros and cons for each. They include: Thrombopoietin ( TPO) receptor agonists. These drugs are also called platelet growth factors. If you have severely low platelets even after treatment with steroids, surgery to remove the spleen, or rituximab, you will likely do well on these medicines, but you may need to take them long-term. A TPO drug may also be used in someone who needs a boost in platelet count for a period of time, such as during an acute bleeding episode, in preparation for elective surgery, or while deciding about, planning, or awaiting a splenectomy. Two TPO drugs are available: eltrombopag ( Promacta) and romiplostim ( Nplate). Eltrombopag is a once-daily pill, and romiplostim is taken by shot once a week. They get your bone marrow to make more platelets. Side effects include nausea, vomiting, headache, and a higher chance of getting blood clots. If you've tried those and still can't get your platelet count to the right level, your doctor may suggest these medicines: A newer drug called fostamatinib ( Tavalisse), a spleen tyrosine kinase inhibitor, is designed to treat thrombocytopenia in adults with chronic ITP who haven't gotten better with other treatments. The initial dose is a pill twice a day. Immunosuppressants, such as azathioprine ( Imuran), cyclosporine, and mycophenolate mofetil ( Cell Cept). They work by keeping your immune system in check. Androgens, such as danazol ( Danocrine). It's not used in women because it can cause unwanted hair growth called hirsutism. Vinca alkaloids, such as vinblastine, vincristine ( Vincasar), and, rarely, cyclophosphamide ( Cytoxan). Doctors sometimes suggest these if you're having severe bleeding and your platelet count isn't getting a boost from other treatments. You can still do a lot of things, but you may need to make some changes to your lifestyle to prevent getting hurt or cut. For instance, avoid sports such as football and downhill skiing. Eat a healthy diet with lots of fruits and vegetables, especially leafy greens, to give your body the nutrients it needs. Ask your doctor if you should avoid food with quinine and aspartame, like tonic water, bitter lemon, bitter melon, some diet sodas, and sugar-free foods. You probably shouldn't take medicines that make bleeding easier, such as aspirin and ibuprofen. Check with your doctor to see if it's OK for you to drink alcohol, and if it is, how much. Your case may be different from someone else's. Your doctor will watch you to see how you're doing. If your case is mild, you may not need any treatment. But even people who do need treatment can lead full lives. Find out as much as you can about your condition so you can best manage it. The Platelet Disorder Support Association has information about ITP and ways to connect with others who also have it.",What are some side effects of prednisone to treat thrombocytopenia?,False,"[""Dexamethasone or prednisone is typically prescribed to raise your platelet count.

"The palms of your hands and soles of your feet make up less than 5% of the skin on your body. That's a pretty small area, but you use them all the time, every day. If they're inflamed with psoriasis, simple tasks can become hard to do. With the right treatment, you can control your symptoms and get relief for your hands, feet, and nails. What Are The Causes? One type of hand and foot psoriasis is called pustular psoriasis. It gets its name from the whitish-yellow blisters, or pustules, it causes. The blisters are not contagious, but they can be painful. They can show up anywhere on your body, but mostly on the palms of your hands and soles of your feet. They can be triggered by: Some medications Irritation from creams or ointments Too much UV light Pregnancy Steroids Infections Stress Stopping medication quickly If you smoke, you're more likely to get pustular psoriasis. It's more common in adults than children, and women tend to get it more than men. What Does It Look Like? The skin on your hands and feet becomes red, and then blisters appear. You can also get scales around the blisters. Your palms and soles can swell, crack, and bleed. Pressure or rubbing on your hands and feet -- like from shoes that don't fit -- can make the problem worse. After the blisters burst, they might dry up or make your skin crusty and brown. How Do I Treat My Flare- Up? Because you use your hands and feet so much, treatment can be a challenge. The condition can affect your ability to walk, button a shirt, hold a pencil, and do many other regular things. It's best if you act quickly and do what you can to prevent flares. Start with a visit to your doctor as soon you notice symptoms. She'll try different options until she finds the one that's right for you. Some treatments are: Medicines that go on your skin Prescription drugs in liquid or pill form Special light therapy units for palms and soles Biologic drugs that you get through an IV or as an injection Your doctor may also recommend you use super glue to seal cracks in your palms and soles. It's important to make sure you don't have an allergy to the glue before trying it. Keep your skin moisturized with lotion and drink plenty of water. When it's dry it cracks more easily, which can lead to more blisters. Skin that's hydrated can also take in on-the-skin treatment better and heal faster. Can It Affect My Nails? Half of all people with psoriasis have it on their nails. If you have psoriatic arthritis, you're even more likely to have symptoms there. Psoriasis can affect your nails in many ways. It can: Change the color or shape Make dents Make them thick with scale under the nail plate Chip or split Make it easier for them to fall off or lift away from the nail bed Be painful to touch Make small pits on the surface What Can I Do for My Nails? Psoriasis affects them as they're forming, which can make it tricky to treat. In some cases, you can use an ointment to take care of a flare-up on your skin, but your thickened nail may keep those treatments from sinking in to the problem area. Instead, your doctor may recommend: Corticosteroid shots Scraping or filing the nail Removing the nails Light therapy Sometimes it goes away on its own, with no treatment. Take some steps to keep your nails safe: Keep them short. Cover loose nails with a bandage or gloves (not latex). Don't bite your nails or use them to open things. Everyday things you do for your overall health help, too. Eat well, exercise, and keep your stress levels low.

"If you're trying to fight off the itchy patches that come with psoriasis, you're probably no stranger to creams, gels, and ointments. There are lots out there, but one of the strongest weapons in your arsenal is something called a topical corticosteroid. It can control the inflammation that makes your skin look puffy and red. "" Topical"" is just a fancy word for something you put on your skin. You can't buy a corticosteroid like that without a prescription from your doctor. The two of you will work together to find the strength and dose that works best for you. Corticosteroids come in a wide variety of strengths. They're ranked on a scale of 1 through 7. If it's labeled ""1"" it means the drug is ""super potent"" or very strong. When it has a ""7"" it's got a rating of ""least potent"" or very weak. Your doctor will weigh several different things before he suggests a specific corticosteroid for you. He'll consider your age, how severe your disease is, and the part of your body that's got an outbreak. He'll also go over with you the potential side effects from the treatment.

"For thousands of years, people have used the gel from aloe vera leaves for healing and softening the skin. In fact, aloe has also long been a folk treatment for many maladies, including constipation and skin disorders. Modern-day research into aloe vera's benefits is mixed, with some evidence showing it can cause cancer in lab animals. There are no foods that contain aloe vera, so it must be taken in supplement or gel form. Some forms of aloe vera are safer to take than others, and chronic use is discouraged. Research backs up the ancient use of topical aloe vera as a skin treatment, at least for specific conditions. Studies have shown that aloe gel might be effective in treating psoriasis, seborrhea, dandruff, and minor burns and skin abrasions, as well as radiation-induced skin injuries. Aloe gel also seems helpful in treating the sores caused by genital herpes in men. There's also strong evidence that aloe juice, which contains latex, taken by mouth is a powerful laxative. In fact, aloe juice was once sold in over-the-counter constipation drugs. However, because aloe's safety was not well-established, the FDA ordered in 2002 that over-the-counter laxatives containing aloe vera either be reformulated or removed from store shelves. Aloe vera gel taken orally (by mouth) seems to help lower blood sugar levels in people with diabetes. It may also help to lower cholesterol. The results of aloe vera studies for other medical conditions have been less clear. Creams and gels with aloe vera vary in dosage. Some creams for minor burns have just 0.5% aloe vera. Others used for psoriasis may contain as much as 70% aloe vera. As an oral supplement, aloe has no set dose. For constipation, some use 100-200 milligrams of aloe juice -- or 50 milligrams of aloe extract -- daily as needed. For diabetes, 1 tablespoon of the gel has been used daily. High oral doses of aloe or aloe latex are dangerous. Ask your doctor for advice on how to use aloe. Researchers warn against the chronic use of aloe vera; however, if the aloe product is free of aloin -- an extract of the plant that has been found to cause colorectal cancer in rats -- it may be OK as a topical remedy for sunburn. Aloin is found between the outer leaf of the aloe plant and the gooey stuff inside. Side effects. Topical aloe vera might cause skin irritation. Oral aloe, which has a laxative effect, can cause cramping and diarrhea. This may cause electrolyte imbalances in the blood of people who ingest aloe for more than a few days. It can also stain the colon, thus making it difficult to visualize the colon during a colonoscopy. So avoid it for a month before having a colonoscopy. Aloe gel, for topical or oral use, should be free of aloin, which can be irritating to the gastrointestinal tract. Risks. Do not apply topical aloe vera to deep cuts or severe burns. People allergic to garlic, onions, and tulips are more likely to be allergic to aloe. High doses of oral aloe are dangerous. Don't take oral aloe if you have intestinal problems, heart disease, hemorrhoids, kidney problems, diabetes, or electrolyte imbalances. Interactions. If you take any drugs regularly, talk to your doctor before you start using aloe supplements. They could interact with medicines and supplements like diabetes drugs, heart drugs, laxatives, steroids, and licorice root. The oral use of aloe vera gel may also block the absorption of medicines taken at the same time. Given the lack of evidence about its safety, aloe vera supplements should not be used orally by children and women who are pregnant or breastfeeding.",How much aloe vera should you use?,False,"['Some creams for minor burns have just 0.5% aloe vera.

"Just about everyone has some acne as teenagers. Sometimes it lasts much longer than that. Even grown men can have it. But there are treatments, even for severe acne decades after you finished high school. For most people, changes in hormone levels trigger acne. These hormones create oils that can lead to clogged pores, which sometimes let bacteria grow. Both of these problems cause breakouts. Men whose fathers had severe acne are more likely to have it, too. Some medications such as lithium, which treats bipolar disorder, and corticosteroids like prednisone can also bring on acne. Men often get acne on the face and back. Sweating can make it worse. Breakouts on the back often happen in hot weather or after exercising. They're harder to control than the kind on your face. But fewer people see your back. Some men get shaving bumps that look like acne, but ingrown hairs or shaving mistakes are the real cause. Keep your skin clean. Many cleansers are available. In general, avoid products with beads in them, because they can irritate your skin. Wash twice a day. Use a fresh washcloth that's gentle on your skin. When you shave, use a clean razor every time. You might want to use an over-the-counter product with benzoyl peroxide, retinol, or salicylic acid. Your doctor can prescribe an antibiotic foam that you can mix with your shaving cream to help prevent breakouts. If shaving bumps are a problem for you, try an electric razor, and don't shave too closely. When you shower, use a cleansing brush with an extension to wash hard-to-reach areas on your back. A sonic cleansing system with a changeable brush head is another option. Benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid products can help control acne on your back. You don't need a prescription for them. But go easy, because these can be drying. A white, cotton tee-shirt is the best thing to have closest to your skin. If you've tried at-home treatments for 4-8 weeks and your acne won't go away, it may be time to see a dermatologist. At your appointment, your dermatologist will check your skin and recommend a treatment plan. You might need a prescription for antibiotics, prescription-strength benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid, or a type of drug called retinoids. If your acne is severe, your dermatologist may consider a drug called isotretinoin. Women who plan to get pregnant must avoid this drug, because it can cause birth defects. But men don't need to take extra precautions to avoid getting their partner pregnant. There are also high-tech options. One of them is a laser skin treatment, and another is light therapy combined with vacuum therapy. These can be expensive, and your insurance may not cover them, so check first.",What can cause a man to have acne?,False,"[""Men whose fathers had severe acne are more likely to have it, too.

"Allergies aren't always to blame for eczema, but the two often go together. Studies show that 1 in 3 infants will have eczema. Here's what you need to know about these conditions in kids, plus advice on how to treat them. Symptoms include a dry, itchy, scaly, red rash. It may ooze and crust over, especially if your child scratches it. Eczema is common on the arms, elbows, legs, knees, hands, and face. The rash can be quite irritating. It can make it hard for kids to sleep. Soaps and cosmetics, cleaners, wool, dust mites, pollen, pet dander, and dry weather can cause flare-ups. Eczema won't spread from one part of the body to another, or from one person to another. Eczema in kids often fades. Most babies outgrow it by the time they're teens or even earlier. Kids with allergies -- especially to foods like milk and peanuts -- are more likely to have eczema. Having parents with allergies or asthma increases a child's risk of eczema. Kids with eczema are more likely to get allergies and asthma later in life. Keeping your kid away from allergy triggers can ease eczema symptoms. If your child has symptoms, see a doctor. There are lots of ways to control eczema and allergies. Tests. Your doctor may want to test your child for allergies to foods -- like milk, egg, peanut, soy, and wheat -- and other substances. Positive results from allergy testing need to be confirmed. Food elimination diets. If your doctor suggests it, you can cut out common trigger foods, one at a time. That will help you figure out if a food is to blame. Ointments and moisturizers. These products can ease mild eczema symptoms. Choose one that's thick, and put it on right after your child gets out of a bath or shower. Medication . Steroid creams can relieve more severe symptoms. Follow these steps to stop the problem before it starts. Allergy-proof your home, so your child won't be exposed to high levels of things like dust mites and dander. Keep her skin moist. Dry skin can trigger eczema. Keep fingernails short. That way, your child is less likely to irritate her skin by scratching. Put socks on your baby's hands to stop scratching when she's asleep. Keep your child cool in summer. Hot weather and sweat can make symptoms worse. Use non-scented soaps. Avoid harsh cleaners. Chemicals can irritate the skin. Dress your child in soft, loose-fitting, cotton clothing. Avoid wool and nylon. Protect your child from dry, cold weather. Dress her warmly when it's cold (but don't overheat). Use a humidifier in the winter when the air is dry.",How do allergies and eczema affect each other?,False,"[""Kids with allergies -- especially to foods like milk and peanuts -- are more likely to have eczema.

At times, it serves a useful purpose. Stress can motivate you to get that promotion at work, or run the last mile of a marathon. But if you don't get a handle on your stress and it becomes long-term, it can seriously interfere with your job, family life, and health. More than half of Americans say they fight with friends and loved ones because of stress, and more than 70% say they experience real physical and emotional symptoms from it. Read on to learn why you get stressed out, and how that stress might be affecting your health. Everyone has different stress triggers. Work stress tops the list, according to surveys. Forty percent of U. S. workers admit to experiencing office stress, and one-quarter say work is the biggest source of stress in their lives. Causes of work stress include: Being unhappy in your job Having a heavy workload or too much responsibility Working long hours Having poor management, unclear expectations of your work, or no say in the decision-making process Working under dangerous conditions Being insecure about your chance for advancement or risk of termination Having to give speeches in front of colleagues Facing discrimination or harassment at work, especially if your company isn't supportive Life stresses can also have a big impact. Examples of life stresses are: The death of a loved one Divorce Loss of a job Increase in financial obligations Getting married Moving to a new home Chronic illness or injury Emotional problems (depression, anxiety, anger, grief, guilt, low self-esteem) Taking care of an elderly or sick family member Traumatic event, such as a natural disaster, theft, rape, or violence against you or a loved one Sometimes the stress comes from inside, rather than outside. You can stress yourself out just by worrying about things. All of these factors can lead to stress: Fear and uncertainty. When you regularly hear about the threat of terrorist attacks, global warming, and toxic chemicals on the news, it can cause you to feel stressed, especially because you feel like you have no control over those events. And even though disasters are typically very rare events, their vivid coverage in the media may make them seem as if they are more likely to occur than they really are. Fears can also hit closer to home, such as being worried that you won't finish a project at work or won't have enough money to pay your bills this month. Attitudes and perceptions. How you view the world or a particular situation can determine whether it causes stress. For example, if your television set is stolen and you take the attitude, "" It's OK, my insurance company will pay for a new one,"" you'll be far less stressed than if you think, "" My TV is gone and I'll never get it back! What if the thieves come back to my house to steal again?"" Similarly, people who feel like they're doing a good job at work will be less stressed out by a big upcoming project than those who worry that they are incompetent. Unrealistic expectations. No one is perfect. If you expect to do everything right all the time, you're destined to feel stressed when things don't go as expected. Change. Any major life change can be stressful -- even a happy event like a wedding or a job promotion. More unpleasant events, such as a divorce, major financial setback, or death in the family can be significant sources of stress. Your stress level will differ based on your personality and how you respond to situations. Some people let everything roll off their back. To them, work stresses and life stresses are just minor bumps in the road. Others literally worry themselves sick. When you are in a stressful situation, your body launches a physical response. Your nervous system springs into action, releasing hormones that prepare you to either fight or take off. It's called the ""fight or flight"" response, and it's why, when you're in a stressful situation, you may notice that your heartbeat speeds up, your breathing gets faster, your muscles tense, and you start to sweat. This kind of stress is short-term and temporary (acute stress), and your body usually recovers quickly from it. But if your stress system stays activated over a long period of time (chronic stress), it can lead to or aggravate more serious health problems. The constant rush of stress hormones can put a lot of wear and tear on your body, causing it to age more quickly and making it more prone to illness. If you've been stressed out for a short period of time, you may start to notice some of these physical signs: Headache Fatigue Difficulty sleeping Difficulty concentrating Upset stomach Irritability When stress becomes long-term and is not properly addressed, it can lead to a number of more serious health conditions, including: Depression High blood pressure Abnormal heartbeat (arrhythmia) Hardening of the arteries (atherosclerosis) Heart disease Heart attack Heartburn, ulcers, irritable bowel syndrome Upset stomach -- cramps, constipation, and diarrhea Weight gain or loss Changes in sex drive Fertility problems Flare-ups of asthma or arthritis Skin problems such as acne, eczema, and psoriasis Managing your stress can make a real difference to your health.

"Pustular psoriasis is a skin disease. You'll see white bumps filled with pus near or inside red skin blotches. These are called pustules, and they can hurt and be scaly, flaky, or itchy. It's most likely to affect: The palms of your hands The soles of your feet Your fingers and toes Even though you see pus on your bumps, it's not an infection. You can't catch pustular psoriasis from someone else or give it to others. Pustular psoriasis usually happens to adults -- it's rare for kids to have it. It can run in families. You can get pustular psoriasis either on its own or with another kind of psoriasis called plaque psoriasis. Pustular psoriasis. Note the clearly defined, raised bumps on the skin that are filled with pus (pustules). The skin under and around these bumps is red. There are three types of pustular psoriasis, based on where the blister outbreaks are or how fast they popped up. Palmoplantar pustulosis ( PPP): Blisters form on small areas of your body, usually your palms or the soles of your feet. These pus-filled spots can turn brown, peel off, or crust over. Your skin can crack, too. This type of psoriasis may come and go. People who smoke are more likely to get this form. Acropustulosis: Small, very painful lesions pop up on your fingertips or toes. The pain can make it hard to use your fingers or toes. In rare cases, it can cause nail or even bone damage. Generalized or Von Zumbusch: Red, painful, tender skin blotches show up over a wide area of your body, and pus-filled blisters pop up soon after. Your skin may be very itchy. You also might be very tired or have fever, chills, dehydration, nausea, weak muscles, headache, joint pain, a fast pulse, or weight loss. This is a rare, serious disease -- see your doctor right away if you have these symptoms. Psoriasis is an autoimmune disease. Your immune system usually sends white blood cells to fight off disease in your body. But in this case, they attack your own skin by mistake. A few things can trigger psoriasis flares: Medications, such as steroids Something that irritates your skin, like a topical cream or harsh skin care product Too much sunlight Stress Pregnancy Infection Hormones A mutation, or change, in one of two specific genes ( IL36 RN or CARD14), may make you more likely to get pustular psoriasis. If you have one of these gene mutations, one of those triggers could set off a flare. You'll see a dermatologist (skin doctor) who will ask about your symptoms, your medical history, and any family history of psoriasis. She may need to take a small sample of your inflamed skin to look at under a microscope. That's called a biopsy. If you have a severe flare, she may also test your blood for signs of high white cell counts; signs that your kidney and liver are working the way they should; and whether you have healthy levels of electrolytes, calcium, and phosphate. The goal of treatment is to ease your symptoms and control outbreaks. What you take may depend on your type of pustular psoriasis. Small, local outbreak: Your doctor may try a topical steroid cream first to treat the sores. Coal tar or salicylic acid creams can help with scaly skin. You'll slather on lotions to soothe and prevent cracked skin. Then you'll slip on cotton gloves or socks to hold the moisture in. PPP and acropustulosis outbreaks can be stubborn. Your doctor may try ultraviolet light treatments on the inflamed skin. This is called phototherapy. Oral drugs like methotrexate or cyclosporine may help calm down your immune system. Acitretin ( Soriatane) is another drug that can slow skin outbreaks. It's a retinoid, or a synthetic form of vitamin A. All these drugs can have serious side effects, so you may need to switch treatments from time to time. If you smoke, try to quit. Smoking makes your psoriasis harder to treat. Widespread outbreak: If you have generalized or Von Zumbusch psoriasis, get medical care right away. You'll need fluids, along with treatments to prevent infection, ease your fever, and calm inflamed, broken skin. While you're in the hospital, you need to rest, stay hydrated, and keep cool. Your doctor may try acitretin, methotrexate, cyclosporine, steroids, or biologics (drugs made from living cells) like etanercept or infliximab to get your flare under control. Once your skin redness and pustule outbreaks have calmed down, you can also try PUVA, where you take a drug called psoralen and then beam ultraviolet light at the affected area of your skin. Sometimes, one treatment doesn't do the trick.

It's most likely to affect: The palms of your hands The soles of your feet Your fingers and toes Even though you see pus on your bumps, it's not an infection. You can't catch pustular psoriasis from someone else or give it to others. Pustular psoriasis usually happens to adults -- it's rare for kids to have it. It can run in families. You can get pustular psoriasis either on its own or with another kind of psoriasis called plaque psoriasis. Pustular psoriasis. Note the clearly defined, raised bumps on the skin that are filled with pus (pustules). The skin under and around these bumps is red. There are three types of pustular psoriasis, based on where the blister outbreaks are or how fast they popped up. Palmoplantar pustulosis ( PPP): Blisters form on small areas of your body, usually your palms or the soles of your feet. These pus-filled spots can turn brown, peel off, or crust over. Your skin can crack, too. This type of psoriasis may come and go. People who smoke are more likely to get this form. Acropustulosis: Small, very painful lesions pop up on your fingertips or toes. The pain can make it hard to use your fingers or toes. In rare cases, it can cause nail or even bone damage. Generalized or Von Zumbusch: Red, painful, tender skin blotches show up over a wide area of your body, and pus-filled blisters pop up soon after. Your skin may be very itchy. You also might be very tired or have fever, chills, dehydration, nausea, weak muscles, headache, joint pain, a fast pulse, or weight loss. This is a rare, serious disease -- see your doctor right away if you have these symptoms. Psoriasis is an autoimmune disease. Your immune system usually sends white blood cells to fight off disease in your body. But in this case, they attack your own skin by mistake. A few things can trigger psoriasis flares: Medications, such as steroids Something that irritates your skin, like a topical cream or harsh skin care product Too much sunlight Stress Pregnancy Infection Hormones A mutation, or change, in one of two specific genes ( IL36 RN or CARD14), may make you more likely to get pustular psoriasis. If you have one of these gene mutations, one of those triggers could set off a flare. You'll see a dermatologist (skin doctor) who will ask about your symptoms, your medical history, and any family history of psoriasis. She may need to take a small sample of your inflamed skin to look at under a microscope. That's called a biopsy. If you have a severe flare, she may also test your blood for signs of high white cell counts; signs that your kidney and liver are working the way they should; and whether you have healthy levels of electrolytes, calcium, and phosphate. The goal of treatment is to ease your symptoms and control outbreaks. What you take may depend on your type of pustular psoriasis. Small, local outbreak: Your doctor may try a topical steroid cream first to treat the sores. Coal tar or salicylic acid creams can help with scaly skin. You'll slather on lotions to soothe and prevent cracked skin. Then you'll slip on cotton gloves or socks to hold the moisture in. PPP and acropustulosis outbreaks can be stubborn. Your doctor may try ultraviolet light treatments on the inflamed skin. This is called phototherapy. Oral drugs like methotrexate or cyclosporine may help calm down your immune system. Acitretin ( Soriatane) is another drug that can slow skin outbreaks. It's a retinoid, or a synthetic form of vitamin A. All these drugs can have serious side effects, so you may need to switch treatments from time to time. If you smoke, try to quit. Smoking makes your psoriasis harder to treat. Widespread outbreak: If you have generalized or Von Zumbusch psoriasis, get medical care right away. You'll need fluids, along with treatments to prevent infection, ease your fever, and calm inflamed, broken skin. While you're in the hospital, you need to rest, stay hydrated, and keep cool. Your doctor may try acitretin, methotrexate, cyclosporine, steroids, or biologics (drugs made from living cells) like etanercept or infliximab to get your flare under control. Once your skin redness and pustule outbreaks have calmed down, you can also try PUVA, where you take a drug called psoralen and then beam ultraviolet light at the affected area of your skin. Sometimes, one treatment doesn't do the trick. You may need to combine one or more to feel better.",What is Von Zumbusch pustular psoriasis?,False,"['Pustular psoriasis is a skin disease.

Whether you have a flaky scalp from time to time or scratchy patches all the time, a dermatologist can tell you if your symptoms are due to a lack of moisture or something more serious. Normally, your body sheds about 30,000 to 40,000 skin cells each day and replaces them with new ones. You don't feel the skin cells growing and shouldn't see any falling, or flaking, off. The outer layer of your skin contains a mixture of dead skin cells and natural oils, which help it hold on to water. If this layer is damaged and moisture gets out, or if your skin cell renewal process goes off the rails, you could get flaky or scaly. Aging, exposure to sunlight and harsh chemicals, some medicines, and certain diseases could also be to blame. If you or your child has red, scaly patches that itch a lot, it might be eczema. This common condition is often mistaken for dry, sensitive skin. Babies and children usually get crusty spots on their chins and cheeks, but scaly skin can show up anywhere on the body. Hand eczema can cause the skin on your palms and fingers to get dry, thick, and cracked. The skin may burn or bleed. Children often outgrow eczema. But adults who never had it can get it, too. Doctors don't know what causes it. They think it's a mix of genetics and things in your environment that your skin reacts to, like: Wool Soap Perfume Makeup Chlorine Cigarette smoke You might notice these symptoms: Red, irritated, or swollen skin Crusting or oozing Scaly patches that feel rough or leathery Severe itching Silvery white scales that cover thick red, raised patches of skin are a telltale sign of plaque psoriasis. Doctors think it results from a faulty immune system. New skin cells grow faster than normal, but old skin cells fail to fall off. The new and old cells clump together, causing thick, itchy patches, sores, and scales There are several different types of psoriasis. Scaly skin is most common with plaque psoriasis. It can show up on your knees, scalp, elbows, palms, lower back and the soles of your feet. The condition may also cause your nails to pit, crumble, or fall off. Psoriasis can be passed down through families. Infections, stress, obesity, and smoking can increase your risk for psoriasis. It isn't contagious. Red, irritated, or scaly skin on your baby's bottom is likely due to diaper dermatitis -- better known as diaper rash. This common condition is usually seen in infants ages 9 to 12 months. It shows up around the folds of the thighs and genitals -- places covered by a diaper Diaper rash can result from an allergy or irritated skin. It could also be a yeast infection -- yeast thrives in warm, moist environments. Signs include a reddish irritated skin rash. At-home care may be fine for irritation rashes, but if your baby's diaper rash won't go away, see a doctor to figure out the cause and best treatment. This skin disorder is the most common cause of dandruff. White, oily flakes of dead skin in your hair and on your shoulders and, sometimes, an itchy scalp are signs of regular dandruff. If you have seborrheic dermatitis, your scalp and nearby skin will feel greasy and be dotted with yellow or white crusty scales. You may even find flakes in your eyebrows. This type of dandruff can also affect the skin behind your ears and on the sides of your nose. A flaky, scaly patch that comes and goes could be actinic keratosis ( AK), a precancerous condition. You could get this scaly skin problem if you spend too much time in a tanning bed or unprotected in the sun. Without treatment, it can turn into squamous cell skin cancer. If you get one actinic keratosis, you usually will get another. The main symptom is a thick, scaly, discolored patch of skin. Sometimes the area feels rough or like sandpaper but looks normal. It may be painful to touch. It can flake off, and your skin may feel normal again. However, the problem spot typically comes back when you're exposed to sunlight. This common condition begins as shiny, reddish-purple bumps. As more grow, they create thick clumps of rough, scaly skin, usually on your ankles and shins. The bumps may also show up on your wrists, lower back, and genitals. They often itch and might blister. Lichen planus can also affect the inside of your mouth and your nails. Middle-aged adults are most likely to get it. Doctors aren't sure what causes lichen planus. It may be an autoimmune disorder. It's often seen in people who have hepatitis C. If you get it, ask your doctor about screening for hepatitis. This group of scaly skin diseases is most often passed down through families. The lifelong condition usually appears in childhood. A genetic problem causes skin cells to build up, creating thick, dry areas that look like fish scales. Certain medicines or diseases, including kidney failure, some cancers, and HIV, can trigger it. If this happens, it's called acquired ichthyosis. There are several forms. Ichthyosis vulgaris (fish scale disease) is common and may be mild. It can go undiagnosed if you keep your skin well-moisturized. Women or girls ages 10 to 35 are more likely to get this skin condition. The main sign is a single round, rose- or tan-colored spot (called a herald patch) in the middle of your body, arms, or legs. A cluster of scaly patches follows about a week or two later. The round spots have raised borders. There may be little or no scaly skin symptoms in children or pregnant women. Doctors think a viral infection (like herpesvirus 6, 7, or 8) causes this scaly rash. It's easy to mistake for ringworm. Other symptoms may include fatigue and headache. A reddish-purple, scaly rash followed by muscle weakness are the main symptoms of this inflammatory disorder. Women are most likely get it. It can occur at any age. It causes swelling in the blood vessels that feed your muscles and skin. You may notice a rash on your eyelids, nose, cheeks, elbows, knees, knuckles, upper chest, or back. Muscle weakness typically affects areas close to the middle of your body, like your hip, back, neck, and shoulders. Muscle pain isn't a main symptom, although some people do report muscle aches. If you have dry, scaly skin that doesn't go away, jot down any other symptoms you have and when they happen. Make an appointment to see a dermatologist.

"Did you know that there are more than 100 types of arthritis? Learn about some of the most common forms, including what they are, what happens, and their symptoms. What is it? More people have this condition than any other form of arthritis. It's the ""wear and tear"" that happens when your joints are overused. It usually happens with age, but it can also come from joint injuries or obesity, which puts extra stress on your joints. Joints that bear weight -- like your knees, hips, feet, and spine -- are the most common places it affects. It often comes on gradually over months or years. It makes the affected joint hurt. But you don't feel sick or have the fatigue that comes with some other types of arthritis. What happens: You lose your body's shock absorber. Cartilage, the slippery material that covers the ends of bones, gradually breaks down. One example is what can happen to your knees when you're overweight. The extra pounds put more pressure on the cartilage as it gets squeezed between the bones. It gets damaged and wears away, so there isn't as much left to cushion the joint. The damaged cartilage makes movement painful. You may hear a grating sound when the roughened cartilage on the surface of the bones rubs together. You may get painful spurs or bumps on the end of the bones, especially on fingers and feet. The joint lining can get inflamed, but it's not common with osteoarthritis. Symptoms depend on which joint or joints are affected. You may have: Deep, aching pain Trouble dressing, combing your hair, gripping things, bending over, squatting, or climbing stairs, depending on which joints are involved Morning stiffness that typically lasts less than 30 minutes Pain when walking Stiffness after resting Your joint may be: Warm to the touch Swollen and harder to move Unable to move through a full range of motion What is it? RA is an autoimmune disease. That means the immune system attacks parts of the body, especially the joints. That leads to inflammation, which can cause severe joint damage if you don't treat it. About 1 out of every 5 people who have rheumatoid arthritis get lumps on their skin called rheumatoid nodules. These often form over joint areas that receive pressure, such as over knuckles, elbows, or heels. What happens: Doctors don't know exactly what causes RA. Some experts believe the immune system becomes ""confused"" after an infection with a bacteria or virus and starts to attack your joints. This battle can spread to other areas of the body. Scientists think two of the body's chemicals that are related to inflammation, tumor necrosis factor ( TNF) and interleukin-1, trigger other parts of the immune system in rheumatoid arthritis. Medicines that block TNF, interleukin-1, and interleukin-6 can improve the symptoms and prevent joint damage. Symptoms can come on gradually or start suddenly. They're often more severe than with osteoarthritis. The most common include: Pain, stiffness, and swelling in your hands, wrists, elbows, shoulders, knees, ankles, feet, jaw, and neck. Rheumatoid arthritis usually affects multiple joints. More than one swollen joint. Usually, it's small joints in your wrists, hands, or feet. A symmetrical pattern. When the knuckles on your left hand are inflamed, the knuckles on your right hand probably will be as well. After some time, you may notice more of your joints feel warm or become painful or swollen. Morning stiffness than can last for hours or even most of the day. You may also feel fatigued and notice that your appetite is down and you've lost weight. What is it? People with this condition have inflammation of the skin (psoriasis) and joints (arthritis). Psoriasis causes patchy, raised, red and white areas of inflamed skin with scales. It usually affects the tips of the elbows and knees, the scalp, the navel, and skin around the genital areas or anus. Only about 10% to 30% of people with psoriasis will also get psoriatic arthritis. What happens: This type of arthritis usually starts between ages 30 and 50, but it can start as early as childhood. It's equally common among men and women. The skin disease (psoriasis) usually shows up first. Symptoms: Psoriatic arthritis can swell the fingers and toes. People who have it often have fingernails that are pitted or discolored, too. In some people, only one joint or a few joints are affected. For example, you could have it in only one knee. Sometimes, it affects the spine or just the fingers and toes. What is it? A buildup of uric acid crystals in a joint. Most of the time, it's your big toe or another part of your foot. What happens: Often you wake up with a sudden, sharp pain in your big toe after a night of drinking. But drugs, stress, or another illness can also trigger a gout attack. The attack will last between 3 and 10 days, even if you don't treat it. It may be months or years before you have another one, but over time, attacks will grow more frequent. And they may last longer, too. If gout goes untreated too long, it can affect your joints and kidneys. Gout results from one of three things: Your body is making more uric acid. Your kidneys can't process the uric acid your body makes. You're eating too many foods that raise uric acid levels. Symptoms: They almost always come on quickly. You'll notice: Intense joint pain: It'll probably be in your big toe, but it could also be in your ankles, knees, elbows, wrists, or fingers. Discomfort: Even after the sharp pain goes away, your joint will still hurt. Inflammation and redness: The joint will be red, swollen, and tender. Hard to move: Your joint will be stiff. What is it? Lupus (also called SLE or systemic lupus erythematosus) is an autoimmune disease. It can affect your joints and many organs in your body. What happens: Doctors don't know exactly what causes lupus, but something makes your immune system go awry. Instead of attacking viruses and other invaders, it starts to cause inflammation and pain throughout your body, from your joints, to your organs, to your brain. Women of childbearing age are more likely to get lupus than men. It affects African- American women more often than white women. It usually appears between ages 15 and 44. Symptoms: Painful, swollen joints Fatigue Headaches Swelling in the feet, legs, hands, or around the eyes Rashes, including a ""butterfly"" rash across the cheeks Mouth sores Sun sensitivity Hair loss Blue or white fingers or toes when exposed to cold ( Raynaud's phenomenon) Blood disorders, like anemia and low levels of white blood cells or platelets Chest pain from inflammation of the lining of the heart or lungs",What happens in psoriatic arthritis?,False,"[""What happens: This type of arthritis usually starts between ages 30 and 50, but it can start as early as childhood.

"From the outside, periods can sound amazing. You're born with hundreds of thousands of eggs. After puberty, a gland in your brain sends a monthly message that says, "" Hey! Release an egg!"" to your ovaries. The process happens about 450 times over your lifetime. From the inside, periods don't feel as awesome. For a few days every month, you can feel like a different person, both physically and emotionally. And not in a good way. Don't let those days derail your life. You can still do everything that you would during the rest of the month, if you know how to manage the baggage your monthly visitor may bring. Though it can vary from month to month, periods usually start off with a light flow, get heavier, then taper off. On average, women lose about 2 to 4 tablespoons of blood during each period. In terms of pads or tampons, that means changing them out every 2 hours or more. If you need to change out less than every 2 hours -- or have quarter-size or larger clots -- let your doctor know. Small clots of blood are common. Your body releases anticoagulants to keep the blood from clotting as it moves through your vagina. But on days when you're bleeding or cramping heavily, it may not be released in time. To get the blood out of your uterus, the muscles tighten and relax. That's the sharp ache you feel between your stomach and lower back. Cramps can start before your period and last throughout the bleeding process. If they feel mild, like someone's giving your ovaries a solid squeeze, it's normal. Try an over-the-counter medication for pain relief. If they take your breath away or have you doubled over in pain, check in with your doctor. You love everybody. You can't stand anybody. All at the same time. Hello hormones. Before and during your period, hormones are hard at work moving your body through each phase. When those hormones rise and fall, so does your mood. During PMS and your period, expect to feel everything from crabbiness and anger to feeling more anxious or down than normal. You can't avoid the mood swings that come with your period, but it does help to get good sleep, stay active, and steer clear of caffeine and unhealthy foods to keep the lows from feeling too low. These choices can also cut down on breast tenderness, acne, bloating, and food cravings that come with the menstrual cycle. Your menstrual cycle begins the first day of one period and ends on the first day of the next. The average is 28 days, and anything between 21 and 35 is normal. But it may not always happen like this. Lots of things can affect your cycle, such as stress, illness, body weight, and diet, including eating disorders. It also depends on ovulation, or when your ovaries release an egg about halfway through your cycle. This may not happen every month, especially at first. Tracking your period can help you understand your own personal pattern. Chart out every day for a few months, including symptoms (mood swings, bloating) and when your period starts and ends. Be detailed about your blood flow: is it light, normal, or heavy? A missed period doesn't always mean you're pregnant. It's normal not to have one once in a while, especially if your body is dealing with something big, like stress, sickness, or heavy exercise. If you miss more than one period, and you've taken a pregnancy test to make sure that's not the reason, talk to your doctor. PMS can make you want to eat the house down. But nausea is a normal part of your period. One of the hormones released during your cycle is called prostaglandin. Though most of it sheds with the uterine lining, some gets into your bloodstream. This can cause nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and headaches. Many over-the-counter pain medications such as ibuprofen and naproxen cut down on prostaglandin production and may help ease these symptoms as well.",What is moodiness like in periods?,False,"[""You love everybody.

"Eczema can affect many areas of your life, including your job. That's especially true if yours is severe or appears on your hands. The itching, burning, and open, oozing wounds that eczema causes can make it hard to use your hands. During a flare-up, you might not be as productive as you'd like. You may not be able to do all the tasks that you'd normally do. You may also need to take time off while you heal or go to doctor's appointments. If your co-workers aren't familiar with eczema, you may worry about what they think about your skin issues. Your co-workers may not know that eczema is a chronic skin condition that isn't contagious. They might not realize it can cause problems (like pain and bleeding, cracking skin) -- or even that it can show up on areas of your body like your hands. If you're embarrassed or ashamed about your skin or the problems your eczema causes, it can help to have a short conversation with your co-workers. You don't have to tell them everything, but you could say something like, â I have a condition called eczema that can make my skin irritated. You can't catch it.â Don't be afraid to ask others for help when you need it. Flare-ups come and go, and you can do your best to return the favor when you feel better. If you're not familiar with what brings on your eczema, talk to your doctor. She may even test you to find out if you have allergies that cause your eczema. Common eczema triggers include: Regular exposure to water (like washing dishes or frequent hand-washing) Antibacterial products, cleansers, or other products that contain alcohol or solvents. ( There are now some hand sanitizers that are moisturizing.) If you can, avoid triggers while you work. Keep them off your skin. Also try to make sure irritating substances stay off your clothes, other work gear, or your work surface. ( If your work area gets cleaned with these things, you may ask to wash your work area yourself, or wipe it down with plain water afterward.) If you have to come in contact with irritating substances, wear heavy vinyl gloves or neoprene gloves with cotton glove liners underneath. A daily routine is one of the best ways to keep eczema at bay. That can also make getting your job done easier. When you wash your hands, use lukewarm water instead of hot, and only use fragrance-free cleansers. After hand washing, blot your hands dry (instead of scrubbing with a towel or using a heated dryer), and put moisturizer on right after. Bring your moisturizer and your eczema medication with you to work. If your eczema is interfering with your work -- or any other part of your life -- see a dermatologist, a doctor who focuses on skin.

"Psoriasis is a skin disorder that causes skin cells to multiply up to 10 times faster than normal. This makes the skin build up into bumpy red patches covered with white scales. They can grow anywhere, but most appear on the scalp, elbows, knees, and lower back. Psoriasis can't be passed from person to person. It does sometimes happen in members of the same family. Psoriasis usually appears in early adulthood. For most people, it affects just a few areas. In severe cases, psoriasis can cover large parts of the body. The patches can heal and then come back throughout a person's life. $('.ua_type_mobile .article table').css('width','100%'); The symptoms of psoriasis vary depending on the type you have. Some common symptoms for plaque psoriasis -- the most common variety of the condition -- include: Plaques of red skin, often covered with silver-colored scales. These plaques may be itchy and painful, and they sometimes crack and bleed. In severe cases, the plaques will grow and merge, covering large areas. Disorders of the fingernails and toenails, including discoloration and pitting of the nails. The nails may also crumble or detach from the nail bed. Plaques of scales or crust on the scalp. People with psoriasis can also get a type of arthritis called psoriatic arthritis. It causes pain and swelling in the joints. The National Psoriasis Foundation estimates that between 10% to 30% of people with psoriasis also have psoriatic arthritis. Other types of psoriasis include: Pustular psoriasis , which causes red and scaly skin with tiny pustules on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet. Guttate psoriasis , which often starts in childhood or young adulthood, causes small, red spots, mainly on the torso and limbs. Triggers may be respiratory infections, strep throat, tonsillitis, stress, injury to the skin, and taking antimalarial and beta-blocker medications. Inverse psoriasis , which makes bright red, shiny lesions that appear in skin folds, such as the armpits, groin, and under the breasts. Erythrodermic psoriasis , which causes fiery redness of the skin and shedding of scales in sheets. It's triggered by severe sunburn, infections, certain medications, and stopping some kinds of psoriasis treatment. It needs to be treated immediately because it can lead to severe illness. No one knows the exact cause of psoriasis, but experts believe that it's a combination of things. Something wrong with the immune system causes inflammation, triggering new skin cells to form too quickly. Normally, skin cells are replaced every 10 to 30 days. With psoriasis, new cells grow every 3 to 4 days. The buildup of old cells being replaced by new ones creates those silver scales. Psoriasis tends to run in families, but it may be skip generations. For instance, a grandfather and his grandson may be affected, but not the child's mother. Things that can trigger an outbreak of psoriasis include: Cuts, scrapes, or surgery Emotional stress Strep infections Medications, including Blood pressure medications (like beta-blockers) Hydroxychloroquine, antimalarial medication Physical exam. It's usually easy for your doctor to diagnose psoriasis, especially if you have plaques on areas such as your: Scalp Ears Elbows Knees Belly button Nails Your doctor will give you a full physical exam and ask if people in your family have psoriasis. Lab tests. The doctor might do a biopsy -- remove a small piece of skin and test it to make sure you don't have a skin infection. There's no other test to confirm or rule out psoriasis. Luckily, there are many treatments. Some slow the growth of new skin cells, and others relieve itching and dry skin. Your doctor will select a treatment plan that is right for you based on the size of your rash, where it is on your body, your age, your overall health, and other things. Common treatments include: Steroid creams Moisturizers for dry skin Coal tar (a common treatment for scalp psoriasis available in lotions, creams, foams, shampoos, and bath solutions) cream or ointment (a strong kind ordered by your doctor. Vitamin D in foods and pills has no effect.) Retinoid creams Treatments for moderate to severe psoriasis include: Light therapy. A doctor shines ultraviolet light on your skin to slow the growth of skin cells. PUVA is a treatment that combines a medicine called psoralen with a special form of ultraviolet light. Methotrexate . This drug can cause bone marrow and liver disease as well as lung problems, so it's only for serious cases. Doctors closely watch patients. You will have to get lab tests, perhaps a chest X-ray, and possibly a liver biopsy. Retinoids. These pills, creams, foams, lotions, and gels are a class of drugs related to vitamin A. Retinoids can cause serious side effects, including birth defects, so they're not recommended for women who are pregnant or planning to have children. . This drug, made to suppress the immune system, may be taken for serious cases that do not respond to other treatments. It can damage the kidneys and raise blood pressure, so your doctor will closely watch your health while you take it. Biologic treatments. These work by blocking the body's immune system (which is overactive in psoriasis) to better control the inflammation from psoriasis. Biologic medications include adalimumab ( Humira), brodalumab ( Siliq), certolizumab pegol ( Cimzia) etanercept ( Enbrel), guselkumab ( Tremfya), infliximab ( Remicade), ixekizumab ( Taltz), risankizumab-rzaa ( SKYRIZI), secukinumab ( Cosentyx), tildrakizumab ( Ilumya), and ustekinumab ( Stelara). An enzyme inhibitor. The medication apremilast ( Otezla) is a new kind of drug for long-term inflammatory diseases like psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. It's a pill that blocks a specific enzyme, which helps to slow other reactions that lead to inflammation. There's no cure, but treatment greatly reduces symptoms, even in serious cases. Recent studies have suggested that when you better control the inflammation of psoriasis, your risk of heart disease, stroke, metabolic syndrome, and other diseases associated with inflammation go down.

An enzyme inhibitor. The medication apremilast ( Otezla) is a new kind of drug for long-term inflammatory diseases like psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. It's a pill that blocks a specific enzyme, which helps to slow other reactions that lead to inflammation. There's no cure, but treatment greatly reduces symptoms, even in serious cases. Recent studies have suggested that when you better control the inflammation of psoriasis, your risk of heart disease, stroke, metabolic syndrome, and other diseases associated with inflammation go down.

"Psoriasis is a skin disorder that causes skin cells to multiply up to 10 times faster than normal. This makes the skin build up into bumpy red patches covered with white scales. They can grow anywhere, but most appear on the scalp, elbows, knees, and lower back. Psoriasis can't be passed from person to person. It does sometimes happen in members of the same family. Psoriasis usually appears in early adulthood. For most people, it affects just a few areas. In severe cases, psoriasis can cover large parts of the body.

Some common symptoms for plaque psoriasis -- the most common variety of the condition -- include: Plaques of red skin, often covered with silver-colored scales. These plaques may be itchy and painful, and they sometimes crack and bleed. In severe cases, the plaques will grow and merge, covering large areas. Disorders of the fingernails and toenails, including discoloration and pitting of the nails. The nails may also crumble or detach from the nail bed. Plaques of scales or crust on the scalp. People with psoriasis can also get a type of arthritis called psoriatic arthritis. It causes pain and swelling in the joints. The National Psoriasis Foundation estimates that between 10% to 30% of people with psoriasis also have psoriatic arthritis. Other types of psoriasis include: Pustular psoriasis , which causes red and scaly skin with tiny pustules on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet. Guttate psoriasis , which often starts in childhood or young adulthood, causes small, red spots, mainly on the torso and limbs. Triggers may be respiratory infections, strep throat, tonsillitis, stress, injury to the skin, and taking antimalarial and beta-blocker medications. Inverse psoriasis , which makes bright red, shiny lesions that appear in skin folds, such as the armpits, groin, and under the breasts. Erythrodermic psoriasis , which causes fiery redness of the skin and shedding of scales in sheets. It's triggered by severe sunburn, infections, certain medications, and stopping some kinds of psoriasis treatment. It needs to be treated immediately because it can lead to severe illness. No one knows the exact cause of psoriasis, but experts believe that it's a combination of things. Something wrong with the immune system causes inflammation, triggering new skin cells to form too quickly. Normally, skin cells are replaced every 10 to 30 days. With psoriasis, new cells grow every 3 to 4 days. The buildup of old cells being replaced by new ones creates those silver scales. Psoriasis tends to run in families, but it may be skip generations. For instance, a grandfather and his grandson may be affected, but not the child's mother.

"Psoriasis is a skin disorder that causes skin cells to multiply up to 10 times faster than normal. This makes the skin build up into bumpy red patches covered with white scales. They can grow anywhere, but most appear on the scalp, elbows, knees, and lower back. Psoriasis can't be passed from person to person. It does sometimes happen in members of the same family. Psoriasis usually appears in early adulthood. For most people, it affects just a few areas. In severe cases, psoriasis can cover large parts of the body. The patches can heal and then come back throughout a person's life. $('.ua_type_mobile .article table').css('width','100%'); The symptoms of psoriasis vary depending on the type you have. Some common symptoms for plaque psoriasis -- the most common variety of the condition -- include: Plaques of red skin, often covered with silver-colored scales. These plaques may be itchy and painful, and they sometimes crack and bleed. In severe cases, the plaques will grow and merge, covering large areas. Disorders of the fingernails and toenails, including discoloration and pitting of the nails. The nails may also crumble or detach from the nail bed. Plaques of scales or crust on the scalp. People with psoriasis can also get a type of arthritis called psoriatic arthritis. It causes pain and swelling in the joints. The National Psoriasis Foundation estimates that between 10% to 30% of people with psoriasis also have psoriatic arthritis. Other types of psoriasis include: Pustular psoriasis , which causes red and scaly skin with tiny pustules on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet. Guttate psoriasis , which often starts in childhood or young adulthood, causes small, red spots, mainly on the torso and limbs. Triggers may be respiratory infections, strep throat, tonsillitis, stress, injury to the skin, and taking antimalarial and beta-blocker medications. Inverse psoriasis , which makes bright red, shiny lesions that appear in skin folds, such as the armpits, groin, and under the breasts. Erythrodermic psoriasis , which causes fiery redness of the skin and shedding of scales in sheets. It's triggered by severe sunburn, infections, certain medications, and stopping some kinds of psoriasis treatment. It needs to be treated immediately because it can lead to severe illness. No one knows the exact cause of psoriasis, but experts believe that it's a combination of things. Something wrong with the immune system causes inflammation, triggering new skin cells to form too quickly. Normally, skin cells are replaced every 10 to 30 days. With psoriasis, new cells grow every 3 to 4 days. The buildup of old cells being replaced by new ones creates those silver scales. Psoriasis tends to run in families, but it may be skip generations. For instance, a grandfather and his grandson may be affected, but not the child's mother. Things that can trigger an outbreak of psoriasis include: Cuts, scrapes, or surgery Emotional stress Strep infections Medications, including Blood pressure medications (like beta-blockers) Hydroxychloroquine, antimalarial medication Physical exam. It's usually easy for your doctor to diagnose psoriasis, especially if you have plaques on areas such as your: Scalp Ears Elbows Knees Belly button Nails Your doctor will give you a full physical exam and ask if people in your family have psoriasis. Lab tests. The doctor might do a biopsy -- remove a small piece of skin and test it to make sure you don't have a skin infection. There's no other test to confirm or rule out psoriasis. Luckily, there are many treatments. Some slow the growth of new skin cells, and others relieve itching and dry skin. Your doctor will select a treatment plan that is right for you based on the size of your rash, where it is on your body, your age, your overall health, and other things. Common treatments include: Steroid creams Moisturizers for dry skin Coal tar (a common treatment for scalp psoriasis available in lotions, creams, foams, shampoos, and bath solutions) cream or ointment (a strong kind ordered by your doctor. Vitamin D in foods and pills has no effect.) Retinoid creams Treatments for moderate to severe psoriasis include: Light therapy. A doctor shines ultraviolet light on your skin to slow the growth of skin cells. PUVA is a treatment that combines a medicine called psoralen with a special form of ultraviolet light. Methotrexate . This drug can cause bone marrow and liver disease as well as lung problems, so it's only for serious cases. Doctors closely watch patients. You will have to get lab tests, perhaps a chest X-ray, and possibly a liver biopsy. Retinoids. These pills, creams, foams, lotions, and gels are a class of drugs related to vitamin A. Retinoids can cause serious side effects, including birth defects, so they're not recommended for women who are pregnant or planning to have children. . This drug, made to suppress the immune system, may be taken for serious cases that do not respond to other treatments. It can damage the kidneys and raise blood pressure, so your doctor will closely watch your health while you take it. Biologic treatments. These work by blocking the body's immune system (which is overactive in psoriasis) to better control the inflammation from psoriasis. Biologic medications include adalimumab ( Humira), brodalumab ( Siliq), certolizumab pegol ( Cimzia) etanercept ( Enbrel), guselkumab ( Tremfya), infliximab ( Remicade), ixekizumab ( Taltz), risankizumab-rzaa ( SKYRIZI), secukinumab ( Cosentyx), tildrakizumab ( Ilumya), and ustekinumab ( Stelara).

"Maybe you're settling into your easy chair for a little Sunday siesta. Or you're heading out the door for a day of fun in the sun. Either way, you stop and pause, because you've got an itch that just won't leave you alone -- along with blotches of red on your skin. What gives? Your doctor needs to make the final call, but psoriasis or eczema could be the problem. Both are skin conditions with similar symptoms, but there are ways to tell them apart. Eczema causes an intense itch. It can get so bad that you scratch enough to make your skin bleed. Psoriasis could also be itchy, but there's something extra going on. Your skin may sting or burn. Some people say it feels like you're getting bitten by fire ants. Eczema makes your skin red and inflamed. It may be scaly, oozing, or crusty. You may see rough, leathery patches that are sometimes dark. It can also cause swelling. Psoriasis can also cause red patches. They may be silvery and scaly -- and raised up high. But if you look closely, the skin is thicker and more inflamed than with eczema. Eczema often appears on parts of your body that bend, like your inner elbow or behind your knees. You can have it on your neck, wrists, and ankles. Babies sometimes get it on their chin, cheeks, scalp, chest, back, arms, and legs. Psoriasis often shows up on places like your: Elbows Knees Scalp and face Lower back Palms of your hands Soles of your feet You may also have patches on other areas, such as: Fingernails and toenails Mouth and lips Eyelids Ears Skin folds Eczema usually results from things that irritate your skin, like: Soaps Detergents Disinfectants Juices from produce or meats Things that cause allergies can also set off eczema, like: Dust Pets Pollen Mold Dandruff Some foods Infections can start up eczema, and so can stress, sweating, heat, humidity, and changes in your hormones.

But you can also get flare-ups when your skin is injured, for example by: Vaccination Sunburn Scratches Some medications can also bring on a psoriasis flare, like , which treats bipolar disorder, or drugs for malaria. Eczema usually starts in babies or young children. Often, symptoms improve when a kid becomes a grown-up. It's less common, but possible, to get it as an adult. When that happens, it's usually because you have another condition like thyroid disease, hormone changes, or stress. Psoriasis, on the other hand, usually shows up between ages 15 and 35.

Psoriasis is linked to other serious health conditions. If you have it, you may also have diabetes, heart disease, or depression. Whether it's psoriasis or eczema, your doctor can recommend ways to get relief for it. Eczema treatment depends on how severe it is. For mild to moderate cases, you'll take a corticosteroid to control inflammation, and you'll use an emollient on your skin. This type of moisturizer has an oil or cream base, not a water base, like lotion, which could dry your skin out more. If you have moderate to severe eczema, you may need to try a medicine that affects your immune system like , methotrexate, azathioprine, or .

For mild to moderate cases, you'll take a corticosteroid to control inflammation, and you'll use an emollient on your skin. This type of moisturizer has an oil or cream base, not a water base, like lotion, which could dry your skin out more. If you have moderate to severe eczema, you may need to try a medicine that affects your immune system like , methotrexate, azathioprine, or . If nothing else works, you might get a biologic drug called dupilumab ( Dupixent). You might also try light therapy (your doctor will call it phototherapy) using ultraviolet light. Psoriasis treatment is either systemic, which means it affects your entire body, or topical, which goes on your skin. If your disease is limited, or mild, you may be able to control it with topical corticosteroids and emollients. Light therapy paired with methotrexate, cyclosporine, acretin, or apremilast is also an option for more severe cases.

You may see rough, leathery patches that are sometimes dark. It can also cause swelling. Psoriasis can also cause red patches. They may be silvery and scaly -- and raised up high. But if you look closely, the skin is thicker and more inflamed than with eczema. Eczema often appears on parts of your body that bend, like your inner elbow or behind your knees. You can have it on your neck, wrists, and ankles. Babies sometimes get it on their chin, cheeks, scalp, chest, back, arms, and legs. Psoriasis often shows up on places like your: Elbows Knees Scalp and face Lower back Palms of your hands Soles of your feet You may also have patches on other areas, such as: Fingernails and toenails Mouth and lips Eyelids Ears Skin folds Eczema usually results from things that irritate your skin, like: Soaps Detergents Disinfectants Juices from produce or meats Things that cause allergies can also set off eczema, like: Dust Pets Pollen Mold Dandruff Some foods Infections can start up eczema, and so can stress, sweating, heat, humidity, and changes in your hormones. Psoriasis shares some of these triggers, like stress and infection. But you can also get flare-ups when your skin is injured, for example by: Vaccination Sunburn Scratches Some medications can also bring on a psoriasis flare, like , which treats bipolar disorder, or drugs for malaria. Eczema usually starts in babies or young children. Often, symptoms improve when a kid becomes a grown-up. It's less common, but possible, to get it as an adult. When that happens, it's usually because you have another condition like thyroid disease, hormone changes, or stress. Psoriasis, on the other hand, usually shows up between ages 15 and 35. But you can get it at other ages too. It's rare for a baby to have it. Eczema usually comes along with dry, sensitive skin. You may have someone in your family who has it or has asthma or hay fever. Psoriasis is linked to other serious health conditions. If you have it, you may also have diabetes, heart disease, or depression. Whether it's psoriasis or eczema, your doctor can recommend ways to get relief for it. Eczema treatment depends on how severe it is. For mild to moderate cases, you'll take a corticosteroid to control inflammation, and you'll use an emollient on your skin. This type of moisturizer has an oil or cream base, not a water base, like lotion, which could dry your skin out more. If you have moderate to severe eczema, you may need to try a medicine that affects your immune system like , methotrexate, azathioprine, or . If nothing else works, you might get a biologic drug called dupilumab ( Dupixent). You might also try light therapy (your doctor will call it phototherapy) using ultraviolet light. Psoriasis treatment is either systemic, which means it affects your entire body, or topical, which goes on your skin. If your disease is limited, or mild, you may be able to control it with topical corticosteroids and emollients. Light therapy paired with methotrexate, cyclosporine, acretin, or apremilast is also an option for more severe cases.

"Maybe you're settling into your easy chair for a little Sunday siesta. Or you're heading out the door for a day of fun in the sun.

"Psoriasis is a common skin disorder that forms thick, red, bumpy patches covered with silvery scales. They can pop up anywhere, but most appear on the scalp, elbows, knees, and lower back. Psoriasis can't be passed from person to person. It does sometimes happen in members of the same family. It usually appears in early adulthood. For most people, it affects just a few areas. In severe cases, it can cover large parts of the body. The rashes can heal and then come back throughout a person's life. Psoriasis starts as small, red bumps, which grow bigger and form scales. The skin appears thick but may bleed easily if you pick or rub off the scales. Rashes may itch and skin may become cracked and painful . Nails may form pits, thicken, crack and become loose. If you have a rash that isn't healing, see your doctor. No one knows the exact cause of psoriasis, but experts believe that it's a combination of things. Something wrong with the immune system causes inflammation, triggering new skin cells to form too quickly. Normally, skin cells are replaced every 10 to 30 days. With psoriasis, new cells grow every 3 to 4 days. The buildup of old cells being replaced by new ones creates those silver scales. Some things that can trigger outbreaks are: Cuts, scrapes, or surgery Emotional stress Strep infections Luckily, there are many treatments. Some slow the growth of new skin cells, and others relieve itching and dry skin. Your doctor will select a treatment plan that is right for you based on the size of your rash, where it is on your body, your age, your overall health, and other things. Common treatments include: Steroid creams Moisturizers for dry skin Coal tar (a common treatment for scalp psoriasis; available in lotions, creams, foams, shampoos, and bath solutions) Vitamin D cream (a strong kind ordered by your doctor; vitamin D in foods and pills has no effect) Retinoid creams Treatments for moderate to severe cases of psoriasis include: Light therapy. A doctor uses ultraviolet light to slow the growth of skin cells. PUVA is a treatment that combines a medicine called psoralen with a special form of ultraviolet light. Methotrexate. This drug can cause liver disease and lung problems, so it's only for serious cases. Doctors closely watch patients. You may have to get lab work, a chest X-ray and possibly a liver biopsy. Retinoids. These pills, creams, foams, and gels are a class of drugs related to Vitamin A. Retinoids can cause serious side effects, including birth defects, so they're not recommended for women who are pregnant or planning to have children. Cyclosporine. This drug, made to suppress the immune system, may be taken for serious cases that do not respond to other treatments. It can damage the kidneys and raise blood pressure though, so your doctor will closely watch your heath while you take it. Biologic treatments. These work by blocking the body's immune system (which is over-active in psoriasis) to better control the systemic inflammation associated with psoriasis. Biologic medications include adalimumab ( Humira), brodalumab ( Siliq), etanercept ( Enbrel), guselkumab ( Tremfya), infliximab ( Remicade), ixekizumab ( Taltz), risankizumab-rzaa ( SKYRIZI), secukinumab ( Cosentyx), and ustekinumab ( Stelara). Enzyme Inhibitor. The medication apremilast ( Otezla) is a new kind of drug for long-term inflammatory diseases like psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. It's a pill that works by blocking a specific enzyme, which helps to slow other reactions that lead to inflammation. There's no cure, but treatment greatly reduces symptoms, even in serious cases.

Your doctor will select a treatment plan that is right for you based on the size of your rash, where it is on your body, your age, your overall health, and other things. Common treatments include: Steroid creams Moisturizers for dry skin Coal tar (a common treatment for scalp psoriasis; available in lotions, creams, foams, shampoos, and bath solutions) Vitamin D cream (a strong kind ordered by your doctor; vitamin D in foods and pills has no effect) Retinoid creams Treatments for moderate to severe cases of psoriasis include: Light therapy. A doctor uses ultraviolet light to slow the growth of skin cells. PUVA is a treatment that combines a medicine called psoralen with a special form of ultraviolet light. Methotrexate. This drug can cause liver disease and lung problems, so it's only for serious cases. Doctors closely watch patients. You may have to get lab work, a chest X-ray and possibly a liver biopsy. Retinoids. These pills, creams, foams, and gels are a class of drugs related to Vitamin A. Retinoids can cause serious side effects, including birth defects, so they're not recommended for women who are pregnant or planning to have children. Cyclosporine. This drug, made to suppress the immune system, may be taken for serious cases that do not respond to other treatments. It can damage the kidneys and raise blood pressure though, so your doctor will closely watch your heath while you take it. Biologic treatments. These work by blocking the body's immune system (which is over-active in psoriasis) to better control the systemic inflammation associated with psoriasis. Biologic medications include adalimumab ( Humira), brodalumab ( Siliq), etanercept ( Enbrel), guselkumab ( Tremfya), infliximab ( Remicade), ixekizumab ( Taltz), risankizumab-rzaa ( SKYRIZI), secukinumab ( Cosentyx), and ustekinumab ( Stelara). Enzyme Inhibitor. The medication apremilast ( Otezla) is a new kind of drug for long-term inflammatory diseases like psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. It's a pill that works by blocking a specific enzyme, which helps to slow other reactions that lead to inflammation. There's no cure, but treatment greatly reduces symptoms, even in serious cases.

"Psoriasis is a common skin disorder that forms thick, red, bumpy patches covered with silvery scales. They can pop up anywhere, but most appear on the scalp, elbows, knees, and lower back. Psoriasis can't be passed from person to person. It does sometimes happen in members of the same family. It usually appears in early adulthood. For most people, it affects just a few areas. In severe cases, it can cover large parts of the body. The rashes can heal and then come back throughout a person's life. Psoriasis starts as small, red bumps, which grow bigger and form scales. The skin appears thick but may bleed easily if you pick or rub off the scales. Rashes may itch and skin may become cracked and painful . Nails may form pits, thicken, crack and become loose. If you have a rash that isn't healing, see your doctor. No one knows the exact cause of psoriasis, but experts believe that it's a combination of things. Something wrong with the immune system causes inflammation, triggering new skin cells to form too quickly. Normally, skin cells are replaced every 10 to 30 days.

"Psoriasis is a common skin disorder that forms thick, red, bumpy patches covered with silvery scales. They can pop up anywhere, but most appear on the scalp, elbows, knees, and lower back. Psoriasis can't be passed from person to person. It does sometimes happen in members of the same family. It usually appears in early adulthood. For most people, it affects just a few areas. In severe cases, it can cover large parts of the body. The rashes can heal and then come back throughout a person's life. Psoriasis starts as small, red bumps, which grow bigger and form scales. The skin appears thick but may bleed easily if you pick or rub off the scales. Rashes may itch and skin may become cracked and painful . Nails may form pits, thicken, crack and become loose. If you have a rash that isn't healing, see your doctor. No one knows the exact cause of psoriasis, but experts believe that it's a combination of things. Something wrong with the immune system causes inflammation, triggering new skin cells to form too quickly. Normally, skin cells are replaced every 10 to 30 days. With psoriasis, new cells grow every 3 to 4 days. The buildup of old cells being replaced by new ones creates those silver scales. Some things that can trigger outbreaks are: Cuts, scrapes, or surgery Emotional stress Strep infections Luckily, there are many treatments. Some slow the growth of new skin cells, and others relieve itching and dry skin. Your doctor will select a treatment plan that is right for you based on the size of your rash, where it is on your body, your age, your overall health, and other things. Common treatments include: Steroid creams Moisturizers for dry skin Coal tar (a common treatment for scalp psoriasis; available in lotions, creams, foams, shampoos, and bath solutions) Vitamin D cream (a strong kind ordered by your doctor; vitamin D in foods and pills has no effect) Retinoid creams Treatments for moderate to severe cases of psoriasis include: Light therapy. A doctor uses ultraviolet light to slow the growth of skin cells. PUVA is a treatment that combines a medicine called psoralen with a special form of ultraviolet light. Methotrexate. This drug can cause liver disease and lung problems, so it's only for serious cases. Doctors closely watch patients. You may have to get lab work, a chest X-ray and possibly a liver biopsy. Retinoids. These pills, creams, foams, and gels are a class of drugs related to Vitamin A. Retinoids can cause serious side effects, including birth defects, so they're not recommended for women who are pregnant or planning to have children. Cyclosporine. This drug, made to suppress the immune system, may be taken for serious cases that do not respond to other treatments. It can damage the kidneys and raise blood pressure though, so your doctor will closely watch your heath while you take it. Biologic treatments. These work by blocking the body's immune system (which is over-active in psoriasis) to better control the systemic inflammation associated with psoriasis. Biologic medications include adalimumab ( Humira), brodalumab ( Siliq), etanercept ( Enbrel), guselkumab ( Tremfya), infliximab ( Remicade), ixekizumab ( Taltz), risankizumab-rzaa ( SKYRIZI), secukinumab ( Cosentyx), and ustekinumab ( Stelara).

Many are minor, some are just an inconvenience, a few are serious, and some are just plain strange. Perhaps the most common set of side effects for drugs that work inside your body involves the gastrointestinal system. Nearly any drug can cause nausea or an upset stomach, though it may only happen to a handful of people. For drugs used on the outside, skin irritation is a common complaint. To find more about a drug's side effects, look on the label of over-the-counter ( OTC) products or on package inserts or printed materials that you get with prescription drugs. Because the inserts often include a long list of possibilities, you may want to also talk to your pharmacist or doctor about what to expect and watch out for. An allergic reaction could happen with any drug. That can range from itching and rash all the way to a life-threatening anaphylactic reaction. Some drugs can't help but trigger side effects because of their chemical structure. The common allergy drug diphenhydramine (also known by the brand name Benadryl) is one. Though it eases allergy symptoms, it also blocks the chemical acetylcholine, and that leads to drowsiness and a host of other side effects, including dry mouth. Some drugs have barely noticeable side effects at the right dose. Typically, warfarin ( Coumadin, Jantoven), used to prevent blood clots, usually works well and isn't bothersome, but serious internal bleeding can happen in the wrong situation. Side effects may show up only when a drug is mixed with certain other things. This might be called a drug interaction. For example, drinking alcohol while you're taking narcotic painkillers can cause an accidental overdose. This has led to many deaths. Another example is grapefruit juice, which can affect the blood levels of several drugs, including some blood pressure and cholesterol medicines. Before a drug can come on the market, the FDA must approve it. The New Drug Applications ( NDAs) submitted by pharmaceutical companies have, first and foremost, evidence that the drug has the effect it's supposed to have and is safe. This proof comes from testing the drug, first in animals and then in humans. Once the basic questions of safety and efficacy are settled, the FDA will approve the drug if it deems that its benefits outweigh its risks. Still, sometimes testing doesn't reveal everything about a drug's side effects, and they don't show up until after the medication enters the marketplace and more people start using it. That's where Med Watch comes in. The FDA's post-marketing surveillance program seeks voluntary input, mainly from health care professionals, on unwanted effects they see in ''the real world.'' Sometimes these reports are numerous or serious enough for the FDA to take regulatory action, such as adding warnings to a drug's label. This happened with the psoriasis drug Raptiva. The FDA required that the drug carry the agency's strongest warning, known as a black box warning, after it received reports of brain infections and meningitis in patients taking the drug. The drug was later taken off the market. The FDA also wants input from consumers when it comes to side effects. All prescription drugs, and many OTC products, must be labeled with a toll-free number the agency has for letting it know about side effects with drugs, called ""adverse events."" You can report possible new but severe side effects through Med Watch at 1-800- FDA-1088 or through the FDA website. Sometimes, the post-marketing information coming in to the FDA is so disturbing that a drug is discontinued. Baycol, which lowers cholesterol, was strongly linked to a breakdown of muscle tissue that could be deadly. The drug was approved in 1997, and the manufacturer stopped selling it 4 years later. The anti-inflammatory drug Duract spent just 1 year on the market. It was approved only as a short-term use product, and the FDA found serious liver problems when people took the drug for longer than recommended. Drug companies are also required to report adverse events to the FDA. Failure to do so can lead to prosecution. In 1985, employees of two drug companies were fined or sentenced to community service for not reporting adverse events involving the blood pressure drug Selacryn and arthritis drug Oraflex. Both products were pulled from the market. Not every side effect is a bad one. Some are downright welcome. Take finasteride. Introduced in 1992 to treat noncancerous enlargement of the prostate gland, it was found to regrow hair. Now it's marketed for that purpose under the name Propecia. Today, millions of men use a low dose of finasteride to treat male pattern baldness. Similarly, minoxidil was originally marketed as a pill for high blood pressure and found to grow hair by people who used it. Today, as a lotion or foam, it's a popular OTC remedy for baldness.",What is the FDA's role in side effects of drugs?,False,"['Before a drug can come on the market, the FDA must approve it.

"Irregular or abnormal ovulation accounts for 30% to 40% of all cases of infertility. Having irregular periods, no periods, or abnormal bleeding often indicates that you aren't ovulating, a condition known clinically as anovulation. Although anovulation can usually be treated with fertility drugs, it is important to be evaluated for other conditions that could interfere with ovulation, such as thyroid conditions or abnormalities of the adrenal or pituitary glands. Once your doctor has ruled out other medical conditions, he or she may prescribe fertility drugs to stimulate your ovulation. The drug contained in both Clomid and Serophene (clomiphene) is often a first choice because it's effective and has been prescribed to women for decades. Unlike many infertility drugs, it also has the advantage of being taken orally instead of by injection. It is used to induce ovulation and to correct irregular ovulation by increasing egg recruitment by the ovaries. Clomiphene induces ovulation in most women with anovulation. Up to 10% of women who use clomiphene for infertility will have a multiple gestation pregnancy -- usually twins. ( In comparison, just 1% of the general population of women delivers twins.) The typical starting dosage of clomphene is 50 milligrams per day for five days, beginning on the third, fourth, or fifth day after your period begins. You can expect to start ovulating about seven days after you've taken the last dose of clomiphene. If you don't ovulate, the dose can be increased by 50 milligrams per day each month up to 150 mg. After you've begun to ovulate, most doctors suggest taking Clomid for 3-6 months before referring to a specialist. If you haven't gotten pregnant by then, you would try a different medication or get a referral to an infertility specialist. These fertility drugs sometimes make the cervical mucus ""hostile"" to sperm, keeping sperm from swimming into the uterus. This can be overcome by using artificial or intrauterine insemination( IUI) -- injecting specially prepared sperm directly into the uterus -- to fertilize the egg. It also thins the endometrial lining. Depending on your situation, your doctor may also suggest other fertility drugs such as Gonal- F or other injectable hormones that stimulate follicles and stimulate egg development in the ovaries. These are the so-called ""super-ovulation"" drugs. Most of these drugs are administered by injection just under the skin. Some of these hormones may overstimulate the ovaries (causing abdominal bloating and discomfort). This can be dangerous and require hospitalization; thus, your doctor will monitor you with frequent vaginal ultrasounds and blood tests to monitor estrogen levels. About 90% of women ovulate with these drugs and between 20% and 60% become pregnant. A common ovulation problem that affects about 5% to 10% of women in their reproductive years is polycystic ovary syndrome ( PCOS). PCOS is a hormonal imbalance that can cause the ovaries not to work. In most cases, the ovaries become enlarged and appear covered with tiny, fluid-filled cysts. Symptoms include: No periods, irregular periods, or irregular bleeding No ovulation or irregular ovulation Obesity or weight gain (although thin women may have PCOS) Insulin resistance (an indicator of prediabetes) High blood pressure Abnormal cholesterol with high triglycerides Excess hair growth on the body and face (hirsutism) Acne or oily skin Thinning hair or male-pattern baldness If you have PCOS and you're overweight, losing weight is one way to improve your chances of pregnancy. Your doctor also might prescribe medication to lower your insulin levels, since elevated insulin levels -- caused by your body's inability to recognize insulin -- has been found to be a common problem among many women with PCOS. Chronically elevated insulin levels can also lead to diabetes. Women with PCOS may be at higher risk for developing heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and endometrial cancer, especially if PCOS is untreated. PCOS can't be cured, but there are treatments available to treat the symptoms of PCOS and the infertility associated with this condition. By stimulating ovulation, especially in women trying to conceive, and treating insulin resistance, regular ovulation and periods often are restored. A procedure known as in vitro fertilization, or IVF, is another potential treatment for women with PCOS. For couples struggling with infertility, it's a particularly cruel fact: Not only can infertility cause a lot of stress, but stress may affect fertility. It's known to contribute to problems with ovulation. For many people, the longer you go without conceiving, the more stress you feel. Fears about infertility may also lead to tension with your partner, and that can reduce your chances of pregnancy even further. After all, it's hard to have sex if one of you sleeps on the couch. While it's a fact that coping with infertility is stressful, that doesn't mean you have to give into it. If your doctor can't find a medical cause for your ovulation problems, consider finding support groups or a therapist who can help you learn better ways to cope with the anxieties that come with infertility. The American Society of Reproductive Medicine offers these tips for reducing stress: Keep the lines of communication open with your partner. Get emotional support. A couples' counselor, support groups, or books can help you cope. Try out some stress-reduction techniques such as meditation or yoga. Cut down on caffeine and other stimulants. Exercise regularly to release your physical and emotional tension. Agree on a medical treatment plan, including financial limits, with your partner.

"Probiotics are a type of ""good"" bacteria found in some foods and supplements. We usually think of bacteria as something that can cause diseases or other problems. But probiotics can help keep your gut healthy. Your body doesn't need probiotics. You already have healthy bacteria in your gut. But it usually doesn't hurt to take them, and adding them to your diet might help. They might lower the number of ""bad"" bacteria in your gut that can cause illness or inflammation. They can also replace those problem germs with good or helpful bacteria. Researchers are studying when and how probiotics might best help. There's more research for some illnesses than others. They might help people with: Diarrhea , especially when it's linked to specific antibiotics. Probiotics also might help with infectious diarrhea, especially in children. Inflammatory bowel diseases ( IBD) including Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Some probiotics might keep ulcerative colitis in remission (a state of little to no disease activity) and prevent Crohn's disease from relapsing and getting worse. Irritable bowel syndrome . Probiotics can sometimes help ease symptoms, including stomach pain, bloating, gas, diarrhea, and constipation. Probiotics also are being studied for many other conditions. There isn't as much research yet, but some people say that probiotics have helped them with: Preventing and treating yeast infections Preventing and treating urinary tract infections Lactose intolerance Skin conditions such as eczema Treating certain stomach and respiratory infections, especially in children Treating allergies and asthma Decreasing inflammation, such as from rheumatoid arthritis Because these good bacteria already exist in the body, they're considered safe for most people. But there are some things to consider. They can trigger an allergic reaction. They might cause mild stomach problems, especially the first few days you start taking them. You might have stomach upset, gas, diarrhea, or bloating. Those symptoms usually go away after your body gets used to them. If you have an immune system problem or another serious health condition, you may have a greater chance of issues. Some reports have linked probiotics to serious infections and other side effects. The people most likely to have trouble are those with immune system problems, people who've had surgery, and others who are critically ill. Don't take probiotics if you have any of those issues. Always talk to your pediatrician before giving probiotic supplements to your child. If you're pregnant or nursing, you should also talk to your doctor before you try one. Most probiotics in the U. S. are sold as dietary supplements. That means the companies that make them don't have to test their products and show that they work or that they are safe. More research is needed to confirm that probiotics are safe and effective. Ask your doctor which probiotics are the right ones for you. Be sure to stop taking them if you have any problems.",How can probiotics be bad for me?,False,"[""There isn't as much research yet, but some people say that probiotics have helped them with: Preventing and treating yeast infections Preventing and treating urinary tract infections Lactose intolerance Skin conditions such as eczema Treating certain stomach and respiratory infections, especially in children Treating allergies and asthma Decreasing inflammation, such as from rheumatoid arthritis Because these good bacteria already exist in the body, they're considered safe for most people.

"Do you often find yourself blinking, squinting, or rubbing your eyes to gain a clearer view? If you have blurry vision, you might chalk it up to age or needing new glasses. But it can be a sign of other health problems, too. Often, treatment for these conditions will clear up your blurred vision. Remember, though, that sudden changes to your eyesight aren't normal, so if they happen, see your doctor right away. The condition raises your risk for an eye disease called diabetic retinopathy. Over time, high blood sugar can damage the tiny blood vessels in your retina, the part of your eye that senses light. That can lead to swelling in a part of the retina called the macula, new and unwanted blood vessels growing in the eye, and bleeding inside the eye. Along with blurry vision, diabetic eye disease may also cause: â Floatingâ spots in your field of vision Permanent loss of vision Early treatment is the best way to ward off permanent damage. So protect your eyes from diabetes by getting them checked at least once a year. Learn more about the symptoms of diabetic retinopathy. One of the key signs that you're having a stroke is a sudden, painless change in eyesight. You might have blurry or double vision. Call 911 right away if you have either of these changes and other stroke warning signs, such as: Dizziness Face drooping Loss of balance Slurred speech or other problems speaking clearly Weakness or numbness in one arm Learn more about the timeline of a stroke. If you're pregnant, you shouldn't take blurry vision lightly. It could be a sign of preeclampsia, a dangerous condition marked by very high blood pressure and protein in your urine. Preeclampsia occurs in women who have never had high blood pressure before and generally occurs late in pregnancy, generally after 20 weeks. It can have serious, life-threatening effects on you and your baby. Preeclampsia may not cause any symptoms, but blurry vision and other sight changes such as seeing flashing lights or spots could be clues that you have it. Be sure to contact your doctor if you notice these as well as other possible signs: Anxiety, shortness of breath, a racing heart, or confusion Nausea or vomiting that suddenly starts after the first trimester Pain in your belly, shoulder, or low back Sudden weight gain Swelling, especially in your face, around your eyes, or in your hands Throbbing headaches that don't go away Learn more about how to lower your preeclampsia risk. A migraine is more than a horrible headache. There are a host of other symptoms that you might have with the pain, including blurry vision and sensitivity to light. You may feel these signs even before a migraine starts, and they may last until it's over. More dramatic changes to your eyesight during a migraine are called an aura. They can include: Loss of part or all of your vision for a little while Seeing flashes of light Seeing wavy lines or spots To solve these problems, you'll need to work with your doctor to treat your migraines and keep them from starting. Learn more about migraine headaches with aura. You may know this condition from these symptoms: Itchy or sore patches of skin Joint pain and inflammation Thick, red, scaly patches on the skin But psoriasis can affect your eyes, too. It can cause a condition called uveitis, when inflammation leads to swelling that causes blurred vision, pain, redness, and sensitivity to light. Treatments can get rid of uveitis, but the type you need will depend on which part of your eye is affected. Learn more about uveitis. Blurry vision is often one of the earliest symptoms of multiple sclerosis ( MS). The disease causes inflammation along the nerve that connects your eyes to your brain, called the optic nerve. That causes a condition called optic neuritis, which can give you blurry sight, loss of color vision, and pain when you move your eyes. It often happens in just one eye. Besides blurry vision, MS also causes: Trouble with balance Bladder and bowel problems Dizziness Feeling very tired Numbness Stiffness Weakness Optic neuritis doesn't necessarily mean you have MS, so talk to your doctor about what's causing it. The problem often goes away on its own, but your doctor can give you some medications to help you heal faster. Learn more about vision problems linked to MS. Scary, but true: A tumor in any part of your brain can make pressure build inside your skull. That can cause many symptoms, including blurred vision. Other signs of a possible brain tumor are: Drowsiness Headache that won't go away Nausea Personality changes Seizures Vomiting If your doctor thinks you might have a brain tumor, she'll use different tests to check how well your brain and spinal cord work, as well as imaging tests to see inside your head. Learn more about the different types of brain tumors. Blurry vision is not the first sign of this nerve disease. But as it gets worse, it can affect sight. That's because the condition may change how your eyes move. As your sight seems less sharp, you may strain your eyes because they have to work harder to focus. Parkinson's disease affects much more than the eyes. It also causes: Poor balance and coordination Stiffness in your body Tremors that affect the hands, arms, legs, and face Learn more about Parkinson's disease symptoms.",How can you treat psoriasis related to blurry vision?,False,"['Treatments can get rid of uveitis, but the type you need will depend on which part of your eye is affected.']"

"In the 1960s and '70s, new info about how the immune system -- your body's defense against germs -- plays a role in psoriasis led to several new treatments. Drugs like corticosteroids, cyclosporine, and methotrexate became mainstays for managing the disease. For the next few decades, though, advances in treatment slowed down. Thanks to recent progress in research, that's ancient history. New biologic therapies work well to treat psoriasis, and other new treatments are close to FDA approval. Research in psoriasis doesn't always make headlines -- or win funding -- like discoveries in cancer or heart disease. And studies are hamstrung by the one-of-a-kind nature of your skin. Unlike many other diseases, experiments on mice or other animals aren't very helpful. In recent years, research into other autoimmune diseases brought new insights about the immune system. It turns out that some of the problems in those conditions are active in psoriasis, as well. The new info brought treatments that target specific areas of your immune system. Called biologics, these drugs launched a new era of psoriasis treatment. They're medicines made from substances found in living things. Doctors inject these lab-made proteins or antibodies into your skin or bloodstream. Once inside the body, the drug blocks part of your altered immune system that adds to psoriasis. In general, biologics work on psoriasis because they: Curb T cells (a form of white blood cell) Block a substance called tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( TNF-alpha), one of the main messenger chemicals in the immune system Stop a family of your immune system's chemical messengers called interleukins Bind to proteins that cause inflammation The patches and plaques of psoriasis come after an interaction between your skin cells and white blood cells. Biologics interfere with TNF-alpha or T cells, or they target interleukins. This short-circuits that unhealthy link. This will ease your inflammation. You'll have less growth of thick, scaly skin, too. Biologic medicines approved by the FDA to treat moderate to severe psoriasis include: Adalimumab ( Humira), a TNF-alpha-blocking antibody Adalimumab-adbm ( Cyltezo), a biosimilar to Humira Brodalumab ( Siliq), a human antibody against interleukins Certolizumab pegol ( Cimzia), a TNF-alpha blocker Etanercept ( Enbrel), a TNF-alpha blocker Etanercept-szzs ( Erelzi), a biosimilar like Enbrel Guselkumab ( Tremfya), an antibody against interleukins Infliximab ( Remicade), a TNF-alpha blocker Ixekizumab ( Taltz), an antibody that binds to inflammation-causing proteins/interleukins Risankizumab-rzaa ( SKYRIZI), an antibody against interleukins Secukinumab ( Cosentyx), a human antibody against interleukins Ustekinumab ( Stelara), a human antibody against interleukins Biologics are good at treating psoriasis.

"Skin comes in all colors, from the palest ivory to the darkest brown and nearly every shade in between. Skin problems, however, are generally color-blind, meaning that most skin conditions can occur in every race and in all skin types. That said, there are certain skin conditions that seem to affect dark skin more frequently or with more severity. Further, many treatments used for common skin conditions can sometimes lead to even more problems when used on people of color. But before you can learn how to protect your face and body, it's important to know a little something about the biology of dark skin. The color of all skin stems from cells called melanocytes. They produce melanosomes, packets containing the natural chemical melanin. Studies show that all people have roughly the same number of melanocytes in skin tissue, regardless of color. What differs is both the size and distribution of the melanosomes. The more and larger they are, the darker skin will be. Since the role of melanin in the skin is to absorb and scatter energy from ultraviolet ( UV) light, having a dark complexion reduces the risk of sun damage, particularly as it pertains to skin aging and skin cancer formation. At the same time, dark skin is more likely to develop pigmentation problems. Even minor skin injuries, such as bug bites, can cause an change in skin pigment, allowing dark spots called hyperpigmentation to occur. When not properly administered, any cosmetic treatment that injures the skin -- such as laser surgery, dermabrasion (removal of dead skin cells), wrinkle-filling injections like Restylane, or Botox injections -- has the potential to cause pigmentation problems. In hyperpigmentation, the skin either produces too much pigment or the pigment is deposited deep within the skin, resulting in dark spots. When color is lost, it's called hypopigmentation, which results in light-colored patches. All people with dark skin are at risk for both skin conditions. Among the most common types of pigment problems in dark skin is post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation. This occurs as a result of skin injury, such as a cut, scrape, or burn. It can also occur in conjunction with eczema or acne. The darkened area of skin can take from months to years to fade, though medical treatments can help. Treatments include removing layers of skin via a chemical peel and prescription bleaching treatments. These treatments won't work on pigment deeper in the skin. Daily use of sunscreen will also help keep a pigmented area from becoming darker. Those with sensitive skin are at greatest risk for pigmentation problems. In fact, any skin care product ingredient that irritates or dries skin increases the risk. The most common products include benzoyl peroxide and salicylic acid (used to treat acne) and anti-aging compounds such as retinoids and glycolic acid. In some patients, the skin-bleaching compound hydroquinone can also irritate skin. In those with lighter skin, product-related irritation normally subsides once use is discontinued. But in people of color, the irritations often give way to post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation. This can develop within one to two weeks after stopping the product and can linger for several months or longer. It's important to note that all these ingredients can be successfully used on dark complexions as long as they are used correctly. Also known as dermatitis, this skin condition is characterized by an itchy, red rash that comes on gradually and lasts a long time. It can be triggered by such things as stress, extreme changes in temperature, dry skin, pet or plant allergies, or irritations caused by skin care or cosmetic ingredients. When eczema occurs as the result of an inherited tendency, it is known as atopic dermatitis. Eczema is believed to occur twice as frequently in children with dark skin. One study found its incidence is higher in Mexican- American teens than either whites or blacks. Other research found a greater incidence in Chinese and Vietnamese babies, compared with white babies. When eczema occurs in those with dark complexions, it presents a two-fold problem: It is often misdiagnosed, leading to long periods of no treatment or the wrong treatment. When not treated early on, it can increase the risk of pigmentation problems. Treatment for eczema consists of identifying and avoiding products that irritate skin. Use of moisturizer can help a lot, along with steroid creams. Sometimes, ultraviolet light therapy is effective. It is essential to seek help as soon as possible for any red, itchy rash. Doing so will help avoid pigmentation problems. Acne can occur in any skin type. But due to its link to hyperpigmentation, it is of greatest concern for people with dark skin. Acne develops when there is an overproduction of oil in the skin. That oil mixes with bacteria within the pores and blocks the pore openings. This causes inflammation just under the skin, which results in lesions -- anything from small, discreet bumps to large cysts. Not only can this trauma lead to pigmentation problems in dark skin, but so can many medications used to treat acne. This is also true of certain oral antibiotics, particularly minocycline. In some people, it can produce a darkening of the skin, which can take months to fade. If you have dark skin and develop acne, see a dermatologist skilled in treating ethnic complexions as soon as possible. The earlier you seek treatment, the less likely you are to suffer permanent pigmentation scars. This skin condition is characterized by bumps under the surface of the skin, and is often confused with acne. But the problem actually stems from ingrown hairs. It most often occurs in black and Hispanic people, due to the distinct shape of the hair follicle. If the bumps are squeezed or manipulated in any way, they can become inflamed or infected. But even when left alone, they can be difficult to cover and sometimes cause pain. Recent studies have shown that laser hair removal is an effective treatment. Because this condition is often confused with acne, it's important to have your diagnosis confirmed by a dermatologist familiar with dark skin. Any time dark skin is injured in certain areas, there's an increased risk of keloids -- a scar that spreads beyond the boundary of the original injury and develops into a growth. The most common causes of keloids are cuts or burns. The most common locations are the earlobes, chest, back, and arms. While they can develop immediately after an injury, they can also take months or even years to grow -- and they can continue growing over a period of time. In some people, keloids may itch, cause pain and burning, and be tender to the touch. Though no one is certain why keloids develop, they are thought to be linked to a defect in collagen production. Treatments include cortisone injections, radiation therapy, pressure dressings, and silicone gel applications. Keloids can also be removed via surgery or with a laser. Regardless of the treatment, keloids return between 45% and 100% of the time. In this condition, skin becomes depigmented. The loss of color causes large, white patches to appear. Vitiligo occurs in up to 2% of the population but is most noticeable in those with dark skin. Vitiligo is thought to develop when melanin-producing cells are damaged, though no one is certain why this happens. A genetic susceptibility perhaps triggered by a factor in the environment may result in an autoimmune disorder, causing destruction of pigment cells. When vitiligo hits the scalp, hair turns white -- and it's occasionally the cause of prematurely gray hair. Treatment includes various procedures to ""re-pigment"" the skin. One such method is controlled exposure to UV light, called phototherapy. This can help increase the amount of melanocyte cells at the skin's surface. Another approach uses the topical eczema oinment tacrolimus, which is sometimes effective. When applied to the skin twice daily, research shows, normal pigmentation may return, although it may take months. Still another approach is the use of strong steroid creams, which can be effective if used on certain areas of the body such as the face and neck. Although dark-skinned people have a natural protection against skin cancer, that doesn't mean it can't occur. It does -- most frequently where skin is lightest, such as the palms, soles of the feet, and around the nail bed. This is most true for Asians, Native Americans, and people of African descent. In Hispanics, melanoma occurs most frequently on the legs. Because it is frequently misdiagnosed as plantar warts (on the soles of the feet), tinea manuum (a fungus occurring on the palms of the hands), or a condition known as talon noir or black heel, and because many people do not seek treatment early on, the melanoma death rate is highest among people with dark skin. The lifesaving answer lies in awareness and early diagnosis.",What is pseudofolliculitis barbae (PFB) like for people with dark skin?,False,"[""This skin condition is characterized by bumps under the surface of the skin, and is often confused with acne.
