Rhinophyma was once thought to be caused by heavy alcohol use. This is not correct. Rhinophyma occurs equally in people who DO NOT use alcohol and in those who drink heavily. The problem is much more common in men than in women. The cause of rhinophyma is unknown. It may be a severe form of a skin disease called rosacea. It is an uncommon disorder. Symptoms include changes in the nose, such as: - Bulb-like (bulbous) shape - Many oil glands - Reddish color (possible) - Thickening of the skin - Waxy, yellow surface Most of the time, a health care provider can diagnose rhinophyma without any tests. Sometimes a skin biopsy may be needed. The most common treatment is surgery to reshape the nose. Surgery may be done with a laser, scalpel, or rotating brush (dermabrasion). Certain acne medicines may also be helpful in treating the condition. Rhinophyma can be corrected with surgery. The condition may return. Rhinophyma can cause emotional distress. This is because of the way it looks. Call your provider if you have symptoms of rhinophyma and would like to talk about treatment. Updated by: David L.

Polycystic ovarian syndrome Is it possible for parents to pass this on in the genes to their children - is there any other way this can be acquired?,"Polycystic ovarian syndrome (Summary): Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is a health problem that can affect a woman's menstrual cycle, ability to have children, hormones , heart, blood vessels, and appearance. Women with this condition typically have high levels of  hormones called androgens, missed or irregular periods, and many small cysts in their ovaries. The cause of PCOS is unknown, but probably involves a combination of genetic and environmental factors . Treatment for PCOS may involve birth control pills and medications for diabetes and infertility. Medicines called anti-androgens are also used to speed the growth of hair and clear acne. [1] [2]"
Psoriasis for past 7-8 years I had psoriasis on my scalp for nearly 10 years. Please give suggestions and medications.,"Psoriasis (What are the types?): There are several different types of psoriasis. Here are a few examples: - Plaque psoriasis, which causes patches of skin that are red at the base and covered by silvery scales. - Guttate psoriasis, which causes small, drop-shaped lesions on your trunk, limbs, and scalp. This type of psoriasis is most often triggered by upper respiratory infections, such as strep throat. - Pustular psoriasis, which causes pus-filled blisters. Attacks or flares can be caused by medications, infections, stress, or certain chemicals. - Inverse psoriasis, which causes smooth, red patches in folds of skin near the genitals, under the breasts or in the armpits. Rubbing and sweating can make this type of psoriasis worse. - Erythrodermic psoriasis, which causes red and scaly skin over much of your body. This can be a reaction to a bad sunburn or taking certain medications, such as corticosteroids. It can also happen if you have a different type of psoriasis that is not well controlled. This type of psoriasis can be very serious, so if you have it, you should see a doctor immediately. There are several different types of psoriasis.

Psoriasis for past 7-8 years I had psoriasis on my scalp for nearly 10 years. Please give suggestions and medications.,"How to diagnose Psoriasis?: In most cases, your primary care doctor can diagnose psoriasis simply by examining your skin. If your doctor isn't sure if you have psoriasis, he or she may order a biopsy. This involves removing a small sample of skin and looking at it under a microscope."
Psoriasis for past 7-8 years I had psoriasis on my scalp for nearly 10 years. Please give suggestions and medications.,"Psoriasis: Psoriasis is a skin condition that causes skin redness and irritation. Most people with psoriasis have thick, red skin with flaky, silver-white patches called scales. Psoriasis is very common. Anyone can develop it, but it most often begins between ages 15 to 35. Psoriasis isn't contagious. This means it doesn't spread to other people. Psoriasis seems to be passed down through families. Health care providers think it may be an autoimmune condition. This occurs when the immune system mistakenly attacks and inflames or destroys healthy body tissue. Normal skin cells grow deep in the skin and rise to the surface about once a month. When you have psoriasis, this process takes place in 2 weeks rather than in 3 to 4 weeks. This results in dead skin cells building up on the skin's surface, forming the patches of scales. The following may trigger an attack of psoriasis or make it harder to treat: - Infections from bacteria or viruses, including strep throat and upper respiratory infections - Dry air or dry skin - Injury to the skin, including cuts, burns, and insect bites - Some medicines, including antimalaria drugs, beta-blockers, and lithium - Stress - Too little sunlight - Too much sunlight (sunburn) - Drinking too much alcohol Psoriasis may be worse in people who have a weak immune system. This may be due to: - AIDS - Autoimmune disorders (such as rheumatoid arthritis) - Cancer chemotherapy Some people with psoriasis also have arthritis (psoriatic arthritis). Psoriasis can appear suddenly or slowly. Many times, it goes away and then comes back. The main symptom of the condition is irritated, red, flaky patches of skin. The medical term for the patches is plaques. Plaques are most often seen on the elbows, knees, and middle of the body. But they can appear anywhere, including on the scalp, palms, and soles of the feet. The skin may be: - Itchy - Dry and covered with silver, flaky skin (scales) - Pink-red in color (like the color of salmon) - Raised and thick Other symptoms may include: - Genital sores in males - Joint pain or aching - Nail changes, including thick nails, yellow-brown nails, dents in the nail, and a lifting of the nail from the skin underneath - Severe dandruff on the scalp There are 5 main types of psoriasis: - Erythrodermic. The skin redness is very intense and covers a large area. - Guttate. Small, pink-red spots appear on the skin. This form seems to be linked to strep infections. - Inverse. Skin redness and irritation occur in the armpits, groin, and in between overlapping skin. - Plaque. Thick, red patches of skin are covered by flaky, silver-white scales. This is the most common type of psoriasis. - Pustular. White pus-filled blisters (pustules) are surrounded by red, irritated skin. Your provider can usually diagnose this condition by looking at your skin. Sometimes, a skin biopsy is done to rule out other possible conditions. If you have joint pain, your provider may order x-rays. The goal of treatment is to control your symptoms and prevent infection. Three treatment options are available: - Skin lotions, ointments, creams, and shampoos. These are called topical treatments. - Pills or injections that affect the body's immune response, not just the skin. These are called systemic, or body-wide, treatments. - Phototherapy, which uses ultraviolet light to treat psoriasis. TREATMENTS USED ON THE SKIN (TOPICAL) Most of the time, psoriasis is treated with medicines that are placed directly on the skin or scalp. These may include: - Cortisone creams and ointments - Creams or ointments that contain coal tar or anthralin - Creams to remove the scaling (usually salicylic acid or lactic acid) - Dandruff shampoos (over-the-counter or prescription) - Moisturizers - Prescription medicines containing vitamin D or vitamin A (retinoids) SYSTEMIC (BODY-WIDE) TREATMENTS If you have very severe psoriasis, your provider will likely recommend medicines that suppress the immune system's faulty response. These medicines include methotrexate or cyclosporine. Retinoids can also be used. Newer drugs called biologics are used when other treatments do not work. Biologics approved for the treatment of psoriasis include: - Adalimumab (Humira) - Etanercept (Enbrel) - Infliximab (Remicade) - Ustekinumab (Stelara) - Secukinumab (Cosentyx) - Apremilast (Otezla) - Ixekizumab (Taltz) PHOTOTHERAPY Some people may choose to have phototherapy: - This is treatment in which your skin is carefully exposed to ultraviolet light. - It may be given alone or after you take a drug that makes the skin sensitive to light. - Phototherapy for psoriasis can be given as ultraviolet A (UVA) or ultraviolet B (UVB) light. OTHER TREATMENTS If you have an infection, your provider will prescribe antibiotics. HOME CARE Following these tips at home may help: - Taking a daily bath or shower. Try not to scrub too hard because this can irritate the skin and trigger an attack. - Oatmeal baths may be soothing and may help to loosen scales. You can use over-the-counter oatmeal bath products. Or, you can mix 1 cup (240 mL) of oatmeal into a tub (bath) of warm water. - Keeping your skin clean and moist, and avoiding your specific psoriasis triggers may help reduce the number of flare-ups. - Sunlight may help your symptoms go away. Be careful not to get sunburned. - Relaxation and anti-stress techniques. The link between stress and flares of psoriasis is not well understood. - Limiting the alcoholic beverages you drink may help keep psoriasis from getting worse. Some people may benefit from a psoriasis support group. The National Psoriasis Foundation is a good resource: www.psoriasis.org. Psoriasis can be a lifelong condition that can be controlled with treatment. It may go away for a long time and then return. With proper treatment, it will not affect your overall health. But be aware that there is a strong link between psoriasis and other health problems, such as heart disease. Call your provider if you have symptoms of psoriasis or if your skin irritation continues despite treatment. Tell your provider if you have joint pain or fever with your psoriasis attacks. If you have symptoms of arthritis, talk to your dermatologist or rheumatologist. Go to the emergency room or call the local emergency number (such as 911) if you have a severe outbreak that covers all or most of your body. There is no known way to prevent psoriasis. Keeping the skin clean and moist and avoiding your psoriasis triggers may help reduce the number of flare-ups. Providers recommend daily baths or showers for people with psoriasis. Avoid scrubbing too hard, because this can irritate the skin and trigger an attack. Updated by: Kevin Berman, MD, PhD, Atlanta Center for Dermatologic Disease, Atlanta, GA.

Psoriasis is an autoimmune disease, which means that your body’s immune system – which protects you from diseases – starts overacting and causing problems. If you have psoriasis, a type of white blood cells called the T cells become so active that they trigger other immune system responses, including swelling and fast turnover of skin cells. Your skin cells grow deep in the skin and rise slowly to the surface. This is called cell turnover, and it usually takes about a month. If you have psoriasis, though, cell turnover can take only a few days. Your skin cells rise too fast and pile up on the surface, causing your skin to look red and scaly. Some things may cause a flare, meaning your psoriasis becomes worse for a while, including: - Infections. - Stress. - Changes in the weather that dry out your skin. - Certain medicines. - Cuts, scratches or sunburns.

Psoriasis for past 7-8 years I had psoriasis on my scalp for nearly 10 years. Please give suggestions and medications.,"Psoriasis: Psoriasis is a common skin condition that speeds up the life cycle of skin cells. It causes cells to build up rapidly on the surface of the skin. The extra skin cells form scales and red patches that are itchy and sometimes painful. Psoriasis is a chronic disease that often comes and goes. The main goal of treatment is to stop the skin cells from growing so quickly. There is no cure for psoriasis, but you can manage symptoms. Lifestyle measures, such as moisturizing, quitting smoking and managing stress, may help. Psoriasis care at Mayo Clinic Psoriasis signs and symptoms are different for everyone. Common signs and symptoms include: - Red patches of skin covered with thick, silvery scales - Small scaling spots (commonly seen in children) - Dry, cracked skin that may bleed - Itching, burning or soreness - Thickened, pitted or ridged nails - Swollen and stiff joints Psoriasis patches can range from a few spots of dandruff-like scaling to major eruptions that cover large areas. Most types of psoriasis go through cycles, flaring for a few weeks or months, then subsiding for a time or even going into complete remission. There are several types of psoriasis. These include: - Plaque psoriasis. The most common form, plaque psoriasis causes dry, raised, red skin lesions (plaques) covered with silvery scales. The plaques might be itchy or painful and there may be few or many. They can occur anywhere on your body, including your genitals and the soft tissue inside your mouth. - Nail psoriasis. Psoriasis can affect fingernails and toenails, causing pitting, abnormal nail growth and discoloration. Psoriatic nails might loosen and separate from the nail bed (onycholysis). Severe cases may cause the nail to crumble. - Guttate psoriasis. This type primarily affects young adults and children. It's usually triggered by a bacterial infection such as strep throat. It's marked by small, water-drop-shaped, scaling lesions on your trunk, arms, legs and scalp. The lesions are covered by a fine scale and aren't as thick as typical plaques are. You may have a single outbreak that goes away on its own, or you may have repeated episodes. - Inverse psoriasis. This mainly affects the skin in the armpits, in the groin, under the breasts and around the genitals. Inverse psoriasis causes smooth patches of red, inflamed skin that worsen with friction and sweating. Fungal infections may trigger this type of psoriasis. - Pustular psoriasis. This uncommon form of psoriasis can occur in widespread patches (generalized pustular psoriasis) or in smaller areas on your hands, feet or fingertips. It generally develops quickly, with pus-filled blisters appearing just hours after your skin becomes red and tender. The blisters may come and go frequently. Generalized pustular psoriasis can also cause fever, chills, severe itching and diarrhea. - Erythrodermic psoriasis. The least common type of psoriasis, erythrodermic psoriasis can cover your entire body with a red, peeling rash that can itch or burn intensely. - Psoriatic arthritis. In addition to inflamed, scaly skin, psoriatic arthritis causes swollen, painful joints that are typical of arthritis. Sometimes the joint symptoms are the first or only manifestation of psoriasis or at times only nail changes are seen. Symptoms range from mild to severe, and psoriatic arthritis can affect any joint. Although the disease usually isn't as crippling as other forms of arthritis, it can cause stiffness and progressive joint damage that in the most serious cases may lead to permanent deformity. If you suspect that you may have psoriasis, see your doctor for an examination. Also, talk to your doctor if your psoriasis: - Causes you discomfort and pain - Makes performing routine tasks difficult - Causes you concern about the appearance of your skin - Leads to joint problems, such as pain, swelling or inability to perform daily tasks Seek medical advice if your signs and symptoms worsen or don't improve with treatment. You may need a different medication or a combination of treatments to manage the psoriasis. The cause of psoriasis isn't fully understood, but it's thought to be related to an immune system problem with T cells and other white blood cells, called neutrophils, in your body. T cells normally travel through the body to defend against foreign substances, such as viruses or bacteria. But if you have psoriasis, the T cells attack healthy skin cells by mistake, as if to heal a wound or to fight an infection. Overactive T cells also trigger increased production of healthy skin cells, more T cells and other white blood cells, especially neutrophils. These travel into the skin causing redness and sometimes pus in pustular lesions. Dilated blood vessels in psoriasis-affected areas create warmth and redness in the skin lesions. The process becomes an ongoing cycle in which new skin cells move to the outermost layer of skin too quickly - in days rather than weeks. Skin cells build up in thick, scaly patches on the skin's surface, continuing until treatment stops the cycle. Just what causes T cells to malfunction in people with psoriasis isn't entirely clear. Researchers believe both genetics and environmental factors play a role. Psoriasis typically starts or worsens because of a trigger that you may be able to identify and avoid. Factors that may trigger psoriasis include: - Infections, such as strep throat or skin infections - Injury to the skin, such as a cut or scrape, a bug bite, or a severe sunburn - Stress - Smoking - Heavy alcohol consumption - Vitamin D deficiency - Certain medications - including lithium, which is prescribed for bipolar disorder, high blood pressure medications such as beta blockers, antimalarial drugs, and iodides Anyone can develop psoriasis, but these factors can increase your risk of developing the disease: - Family history. This is one of the most significant risk factors. Having one parent with psoriasis increases your risk of getting the disease, and having two parents with psoriasis increases your risk even more. - Viral and bacterial infections. People with HIV are more likely to develop psoriasis than people with healthy immune systems are. Children and young adults with recurring infections, particularly strep throat, also may be at increased risk. - Stress. Because stress can impact your immune system, high stress levels may increase your risk of psoriasis. - Obesity. Excess weight increases the risk of psoriasis. Lesions (plaques) associated with all types of psoriasis often develop in skin creases and folds. - Smoking. Smoking tobacco not only increases your risk of psoriasis but also may increase the severity of the disease. Smoking may also play a role in the initial development of the disease. In most cases, diagnosis of psoriasis is fairly straightforward. - Physical exam and medical history. Your doctor usually can diagnose psoriasis by taking your medical history and examining your skin, scalp and nails. - Skin biopsy. Rarely, your doctor may take a small sample of skin (biopsy). He or she will likely first apply a local anesthetic. The sample is examined under a microscope to determine the exact type of psoriasis and to rule out other disorders. Psoriasis treatments reduce inflammation and clear the skin. Treatments can be divided into three main types: topical treatments, light therapy and systemic medications. Topical treatments Used alone, creams and ointments that you apply to your skin can effectively treat mild to moderate psoriasis. When the disease is more severe, creams are likely to be combined with oral medications or light therapy. Topical psoriasis treatments include: - Topical corticosteroids. These drugs are the most frequently prescribed medications for treating mild to moderate psoriasis. They reduce inflammation and relieve itching and may be used with other treatments. Mild corticosteroid ointments are usually recommended for sensitive areas, such as your face or skin folds, and for treating widespread patches of damaged skin. Your doctor may prescribe stronger corticosteroid ointment for smaller, less sensitive or tougher-to-treat areas. Long-term use or overuse of strong corticosteroids can cause thinning of the skin. Topical corticosteroids may stop working over time. It's usually best to use topical corticosteroids as a short-term treatment during flares. - Vitamin D analogues. These synthetic forms of vitamin D slow skin cell growth. Calcipotriene (Dovonex) is a prescription cream or solution containing a vitamin D analogue that treats mild to moderate psoriasis along with other treatments. Calcipotriene might irritate your skin. Calcitriol (Vectical) is expensive but may be equally effective and possibly less irritating than calcipotriene. - Anthralin. This medication helps slow skin cell growth. Anthralin (Dritho-Scalp) can also remove scales and make skin smoother. But anthralin can irritate skin, and it stains almost anything it touches. It's usually applied for a short time and then washed off. - Topical retinoids. These are vitamin A derivatives that may decrease inflammation. The most common side effect is skin irritation. These medications may also increase sensitivity to sunlight, so while using the medication apply sunscreen before going outdoors. The risk of birth defects is far lower for topical retinoids than for oral retinoids. But tazarotene (Tazorac, Avage) isn't recommended when you're pregnant or breast-feeding or if you intend to become pregnant. - Calcineurin inhibitors. Calcineurin inhibitors - tacrolimus (Prograf) and pimecrolimus (Elidel) - reduce inflammation and plaque buildup. Calcineurin inhibitors are not recommended for long-term or continuous use because of a potential increased risk of skin cancer and lymphoma. They may be especially helpful in areas of thin skin, such as around the eyes, where steroid creams or retinoids are too irritating or may cause harmful effects. - Salicylic acid. Available over-the-counter (nonprescription) and by prescription, salicylic acid promotes sloughing of dead skin cells and reduces scaling. Sometimes it's combined with other medications, such as topical corticosteroids or coal tar, to increase its effectiveness. Salicylic acid is available in medicated shampoos and scalp solutions to treat scalp psoriasis. - Coal tar. Derived from coal, coal tar reduces scaling, itching and inflammation. Coal tar can irritate the skin. It's also messy, stains clothing and bedding, and has a strong odor. Coal tar is available in over-the-counter shampoos, creams and oils. It's also available in higher concentrations by prescription. This treatment isn't recommended for women who are pregnant or breast-feeding. - Moisturizers. Moisturizing creams alone won't heal psoriasis, but they can reduce itching, scaling and dryness. Moisturizers in an ointment base are usually more effective than are lighter creams and lotions. Apply immediately after a bath or shower to lock in moisture. Light therapy (phototherapy) This treatment uses natural or artificial ultraviolet light. The simplest and easiest form of phototherapy involves exposing your skin to controlled amounts of natural sunlight. Other forms of light therapy include the use of artificial ultraviolet A (UVA) or ultraviolet B (UVB) light, either alone or in combination with medications. - Sunlight. Exposure to ultraviolet (UV) rays in sunlight or artificial light slows skin cell turnover and reduces scaling and inflammation. Brief, daily exposures to small amounts of sunlight may improve psoriasis, but intense sun exposure can worsen symptoms and cause skin damage. Before beginning a sunlight regimen, ask your doctor about the safest way to use natural sunlight for psoriasis treatment. - UVB phototherapy. Controlled doses of UVB light from an artificial light source may improve mild to moderate psoriasis symptoms. UVB phototherapy, also called broadband UVB, can be used to treat single patches, widespread psoriasis and psoriasis that resists topical treatments. Short-term side effects may include redness, itching and dry skin. Using a moisturizer may help decrease these side effects. - Narrow band UVB phototherapy. A newer type of psoriasis treatment, narrow band UVB phototherapy may be more effective than broadband UVB treatment. It's usually administered two or three times a week until the skin improves, and then maintenance may require only weekly sessions. Narrow band UVB phototherapy may cause more-severe and longer lasting burns, however. - Goeckerman therapy. Some doctors combine UVB treatment and coal tar treatment, which is known as Goeckerman treatment. The two therapies together are more effective than either alone because coal tar makes skin more receptive to UVB light. - Psoralen plus ultraviolet A (PUVA). This form of photochemotherapy involves taking a light-sensitizing medication (psoralen) before exposure to UVA light. UVA light penetrates deeper into the skin than does UVB light, and psoralen makes the skin more responsive to UVA exposure. This more aggressive treatment consistently improves skin and is often used for more-severe cases of psoriasis. Short-term side effects include nausea, headache, burning and itching. Long-term side effects include dry and wrinkled skin, freckles, increased sun sensitivity, and increased risk of skin cancer, including melanoma. - Excimer laser. This form of light therapy, used for mild to moderate psoriasis, treats only the involved skin without harming healthy skin. A controlled beam of UVB light is directed to the psoriasis plaques to control scaling and inflammation. Excimer laser therapy requires fewer sessions than does traditional phototherapy because more powerful UVB light is used. Side effects can include redness and blistering. Oral or injected medications If you have severe psoriasis or it's resistant to other types of treatment, your doctor may prescribe oral or injected drugs. This is known as systemic treatment. Because of severe side effects, some of these medications are used for only brief periods and may be alternated with other forms of treatment. - Retinoids. Related to vitamin A, this group of drugs may help if you have severe psoriasis that doesn't respond to other therapies. Side effects may include lip inflammation and hair loss. And because retinoids such as acitretin (Soriatane) can cause severe birth defects, women must avoid pregnancy for at least three years after taking the medication. - Methotrexate. Taken orally, methotrexate (Rheumatrex) helps psoriasis by decreasing the production of skin cells and suppressing inflammation. It may also slow the progression of psoriatic arthritis in some people. Methotrexate is generally well-tolerated in low doses but may cause upset stomach, loss of appetite and fatigue. When used for long periods, it can cause a number of serious side effects, including severe liver damage and decreased production of red and white blood cells and platelets. - Cyclosporine. Cyclosporine (Gengraf, Neoral) suppresses the immune system and is similar to methotrexate in effectiveness, but can only be taken short-term. Like other immunosuppressant drugs, cyclosporine increases your risk of infection and other health problems, including cancer. Cyclosporine also makes you more susceptible to kidney problems and high blood pressure - the risk increases with higher dosages and long-term therapy. - Drugs that alter the immune system (biologics). Several of these drugs are approved for the treatment of moderate to severe psoriasis. They include etanercept (Enbrel), infliximab (Remicade), adalimumab (Humira), ustekinumab (Stelara), golimumab (Simponi), apremilast (Otezla), secukinumab (Cosentyx) and ixekizumab (Taltz). Most of these drugs are given by injection (apremilast is oral) and are usually used for people who have failed to respond to traditional therapy or who have associated psoriatic arthritis. Biologics must be used with caution because they have strong effects on the immune system and may permit life-threatening infections. In particular, people taking these treatments must be screened for tuberculosis. - Other medications. Thioguanine (Tabloid) and hydroxyurea (Droxia, Hydrea) are medications that can be used when other drugs can't be given. Treatment considerations Although doctors choose treatments based on the type and severity of psoriasis and the areas of skin affected, the traditional approach is to start with the mildest treatments - topical creams and ultraviolet light therapy (phototherapy) - in those patients with typical skin lesions (plaques) and then progress to stronger ones only if necessary. Patients with pustular or erythrodermic psoriasis or associated arthritis usually need systemic therapy from the beginning of treatment. The goal is to find the most effective way to slow cell turnover with the fewest possible side effects. Potential future treatments There are a number of new medications currently being researched that have the potential to improve psoriasis treatment. These treatments target different proteins that work with the immune system. Alternative medicine A number of alternative therapies claim to ease the symptoms of psoriasis, including special diets, creams, dietary supplements and herbs. None have definitively been proved effective. But some alternative therapies are deemed generally safe, and they may be helpful to some people in reducing signs and symptoms, such as itching and scaling. These treatments would be most appropriate for those with milder, plaque disease and not for those with pustules, erythroderma or arthritis. - Aloe vera. Taken from the leaves of the aloe vera plant, aloe extract cream may reduce redness, scaling, itching and inflammation. You may need to use the cream several times a day for a month or more to see any improvements in your skin. - Fish oil. Omega-3 fatty acids found in fish oil supplements may reduce inflammation associated with psoriasis, although results from studies are mixed. Taking 3 grams or less of fish oil daily is generally recognized as safe, and you may find it beneficial. - Oregon grape. Also known as barberry, topical applications of Oregon grape may reduce inflammation and ease psoriasis symptoms. If you're considering dietary supplements or other alternative therapy to ease the symptoms of psoriasis, consult your doctor. He or she can help you weigh the pros and cons of specific alternative therapies. Although self-help measures won't cure psoriasis, they may help improve the appearance and feel of damaged skin. These measures may benefit you: - Take daily baths. Bathing daily helps remove scales and calm inflamed skin. Add bath oil, colloidal oatmeal, Epsom salts or Dead Sea salts to the water and soak. Avoid hot water and harsh soaps, which can worsen symptoms; use lukewarm water and mild soaps that have added oils and fats. Soak about 10 minutes then gently pat dry skin. - Use moisturizer. After bathing, apply a heavy, ointment-based moisturizer while your skin is still moist. For very dry skin, oils may be preferable - they have more staying power than creams or lotions do and are more effective at preventing water from evaporating from your skin. During cold, dry weather, you may need to apply a moisturizer several times a day. - Expose your skin to small amounts of sunlight. A controlled amount of sunlight can improve psoriasis, but too much sun can trigger or worsen outbreaks and increase the risk of skin cancer. First ask your doctor about the best way to use natural sunlight to treat your skin. Log your time in the sun, and protect skin that isn't affected by psoriasis with sunscreen. - Avoid psoriasis triggers, if possible. Find out what triggers, if any, worsen your psoriasis and take steps to prevent or avoid them. Infections, injuries to your skin, stress, smoking and intense sun exposure can all worsen psoriasis. - Avoid drinking alcohol. Alcohol consumption may decrease the effectiveness of some psoriasis treatments. If you have psoriasis, avoid alcohol. If you do drink, keep it moderate."

"varicella shingles How can I determine whether or not I've had chicken pox. If there is a test for it, what are the results of the tests I need to know that will tell me whether or not I have had chicken pox? I want to know this to determine if I should have shingles vaccine (Zostavax) Thank you.","Chickenpox (Symptoms): Most children with chickenpox have the following symptoms before the rash appears: - Fever - Headache - Stomach ache The chickenpox rash occurs about 10 to 21 days after coming into contact with someone who had the disease. In most cases, a child will develop 250 to 500 small, itchy, fluid-filled blisters over red spots on the skin. - The blisters are most often first seen on the face, middle of the body, or scalp. - After a day or two, the blisters become cloudy and then scab. Meanwhile, new blisters form in groups. They often appear in the mouth, in the vagina, and on the eyelids. - Children with skin problems, such as eczema, may get thousands of blisters. Most pox will not leave scars unless they become infected with bacteria from scratching. Some children who have had the vaccine will still develop a mild case of chickenpox. In most cases, they recover much more quickly and have only a few poxes (fewer than 30). These cases are often harder to diagnose. However, these children can still spread chickenpox to others."

I want to know this to determine if I should have shingles vaccine (Zostavax) Thank you.","Chickenpox (Treatment): Treatment involves keeping the person as comfortable as possible. Here are things to try: - Avoid scratching or rubbing the itchy areas. Keep fingernails short to avoid damaging the skin from scratching. - Wear cool, light, loose bedclothes. Avoid wearing rough clothing, particularly wool, over an itchy area. - Take lukewarm baths using little soap and rinse thoroughly. Try a skin-soothing oatmeal or cornstarch bath. - Apply a soothing moisturizer after bathing to soften and cool the skin. - Avoid prolonged exposure to excessive heat and humidity. - Try over-the-counter oral antihistamines such as diphenhydramine (Benadryl), but be aware of possible side effects, such as drowsiness. - Try over-the-counter hydrocortisone cream on itchy areas. Medicines that fight the chickenpox virus are available, but not given to everyone. To work well, the medicine should be started within the first 24 hours of the rash. - Antiviral drugs are not very often prescribed to otherwise healthy children who do not have severe symptoms. Adults and teens, who are at risk for more severe symptoms, may benefit from antiviral medicine if it is given early. - Antiviral medicine may be very important for those who have skin conditions (such as eczema or recent sunburn), lung conditions (such as asthma), or who have recently taken steroids. - Some providers also give antiviral medicines to people in the same household who also develop chickenpox, because they will most often develop more severe symptoms. Do NOT give aspirin or ibuprofen to someone who may have chickenpox. Use of aspirin has been associated with a serious condition called Reyes syndrome. Ibuprofen has been associated with more severe secondary infections. Acetaminophen (Tylenol) may be used. A child with chickenpox should not return to school or play with other children until all chickenpox sores have crusted over or dried out. Adults should follow this same rule while considering when to return to work or be around others."
how do you check for lupus?,"Lupus: Lupus is a systemic autoimmune disease that occurs when your body's immune system attacks your own tissues and organs. Inflammation caused by lupus can affect many different body systems - including your joints, skin, kidneys, blood cells, brain, heart and lungs. Lupus can be difficult to diagnose because its signs and symptoms often mimic those of other ailments. The most distinctive sign of lupus - a facial rash that resembles the wings of a butterfly unfolding across both cheeks - occurs in many but not all cases of lupus. Some people are born with a tendency toward developing lupus, which may be triggered by infections, certain drugs or even sunlight. While there's no cure for lupus, treatments can help control symptoms. No two cases of lupus are exactly alike. Signs and symptoms may come on suddenly or develop slowly, may be mild or severe, and may be temporary or permanent. Most people with lupus have mild disease characterized by episodes - called flares - when signs and symptoms get worse for a while, then improve or even disappear completely for a time. The signs and symptoms of lupus that you experience will depend on which body systems are affected by the disease. The most common signs and symptoms include: - Fatigue - Fever - Joint pain, stiffness and swelling - Butterfly-shaped rash on the face that covers the cheeks and bridge of the nose or rashes elsewhere on the body - Skin lesions that appear or worsen with sun exposure (photosensitivity) - Fingers and toes that turn white or blue when exposed to cold or during stressful periods (Raynaud's phenomenon) - Shortness of breath - Chest pain - Dry eyes - Headaches, confusion and memory loss When to see a doctor See your doctor if you develop an unexplained rash, ongoing fever, persistent aching or fatigue. Lupus occurs when your immune system attacks healthy tissue in your body (autoimmune disease). It's likely that lupus results from a combination of your genetics and your environment. It appears that people with an inherited predisposition for lupus may develop the disease when they come into contact with something in the environment that can trigger lupus. The cause of lupus in most cases, however, is unknown. Some potential triggers include: - Sunlight. Exposure to the sun may bring on lupus skin lesions or trigger an internal response in susceptible people. - Infections. Having an infection can initiate lupus or cause a relapse in some people. - Medications. Lupus can be triggered by certain types of blood pressure medications, anti-seizure medications and antibiotics. People who have drug-induced lupus usually get better when they stop taking the medication. Rarely, symptoms may persist even after the drug is stopped. Factors that may increase your risk of lupus include: - Your sex. Lupus is more common in women. - Age. Although lupus affects people of all ages, it's most often diagnosed between the ages of 15 and 45. - Race. Lupus is more common in African-Americans, Hispanics and Asian-Americans. Diagnosing lupus is difficult because signs and symptoms vary considerably from person to person. Signs and symptoms of lupus may vary over time and overlap with those of many other disorders. No one test can diagnose lupus. The combination of blood and urine tests, signs and symptoms, and physical examination findings leads to the diagnosis. Laboratory tests Blood and urine tests may include: - Complete blood count. This test measures the number of red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets as well as the amount of hemoglobin, a protein in red blood cells. Results may indicate you have anemia, which commonly occurs in lupus. A low white blood cell or platelet count may occur in lupus as well. - Erythrocyte sedimentation rate. This blood test determines the rate at which red blood cells settle to the bottom of a tube in an hour. A faster than normal rate may indicate a systemic disease, such as lupus. The sedimentation rate isn't specific for any one disease. It may be elevated if you have lupus, an infection, another inflammatory condition or cancer. - Kidney and liver assessment. Blood tests can assess how well your kidneys and liver are functioning. Lupus can affect these organs. - Urinalysis. An examination of a sample of your urine may show an increased protein level or red blood cells in the urine, which may occur if lupus has affected your kidneys. - Antinuclear antibody (ANA) test. A positive test for the presence of these antibodies - produced by your immune system - indicates a stimulated immune system. While most people with lupus have a positive ANA test, most people with a positive ANA do not have lupus. If you test positive for ANA, your doctor may advise more-specific antibody testing. Imaging tests If your doctor suspects that lupus is affecting your lungs or heart, he or she may suggest: - Chest X-ray. An image of your chest may reveal abnormal shadows that suggest fluid or inflammation in your lungs. - Echocardiogram. This test uses sound waves to produce real-time images of your beating heart. It can check for problems with your valves and other portions of your heart. Biopsy Lupus can harm your kidneys in many different ways, and treatments can vary, depending on the type of damage that occurs. In some cases, it's necessary to test a small sample of kidney tissue to determine what the best treatment might be. The sample can be obtained with a needle or through a small incision. Skin biopsy is sometimes performed to confirm a diagnosis of lupus affecting the skin. Treatment for lupus depends on your signs and symptoms. Determining whether your signs and symptoms should be treated and what medications to use requires a careful discussion of the benefits and risks with your doctor. As your signs and symptoms flare and subside, you and your doctor may find that you'll need to change medications or dosages. The medications most commonly used to control lupus include: - Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Over-the-counter NSAIDs, such as naproxen sodium (Aleve) and ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others), may be used to treat pain, swelling and fever associated with lupus. Stronger NSAIDs are available by prescription. Side effects of NSAIDs include stomach bleeding, kidney problems and an increased risk of heart problems. - Antimalarial drugs. Medications commonly used to treat malaria, such as hydroxychloroquine (Plaquenil), affect the immune system and can help decrease the risk of lupus flares. Side effects can include stomach upset and, very rarely, damage to the retina of the eye. Regular eye exams are recommended when taking these medications. - Corticosteroids. Prednisone and other types of corticosteroids can counter the inflammation of lupus. High doses of steroids such as methylprednisolone (A-Methapred, Medrol) are often used to control serious disease that involves the kidneys and brain. Side effects include weight gain, easy bruising, thinning bones (osteoporosis), high blood pressure, diabetes and increased risk of infection. The risk of side effects increases with higher doses and longer term therapy. - Immunosuppressants. Drugs that suppress the immune system may be helpful in serious cases of lupus. Examples include azathioprine (Imuran, Azasan), mycophenolate mofetil (CellCept) and methotrexate (Trexall). Potential side effects may include an increased risk of infection, liver damage, decreased fertility and an increased risk of cancer. - Biologics. A different type of medication, belimumab (Benlysta) administered intravenously, also reduces lupus symptoms in some people. Side effects include nausea, diarrhea and infections. Rarely, worsening of depression can occur. - Rituximab (Rituxan) can be beneficial in cases of resistant lupus. Side effects include allergic reaction to the intravenous infusion and infections. Take steps to care for your body if you have lupus. Simple measures can help you prevent lupus flares and, should they occur, better cope with the signs and symptoms you experience. Try to: - See your doctor regularly. Having regular checkups instead of only seeing your doctor when your symptoms worsen may help your doctor prevent flare-ups, and can be useful in addressing routine health concerns, such as stress, diet and exercise that can be helpful in preventing lupus complications. - Be sun smart. Because ultraviolet light can trigger a flare, wear protective clothing - such as a hat, long-sleeved shirt and long pants - and use sunscreens with a sun protection factor (SPF) of at least 55 every time you go outside. - Get regular exercise. Exercise can help keep your bones strong, reduce your risk of heart attack and promote general well-being. - Don't smoke. Smoking increases your risk of cardiovascular disease and can worsen the effects of lupus on your heart and blood vessels. - Eat a healthy diet. A healthy diet emphasizes fruits, vegetables and whole grains. Sometimes you may have dietary restrictions, especially if you have high blood pressure, kidney damage or gastrointestinal problems. - Ask your doctor if you need vitamin D and calcium supplements. There is some evidence to suggest that people with lupus may benefit from supplemental vitamin D. A 1,200- to 1,500-milligram calcium supplement taken daily may help keep your bones healthy. Sometimes people with lupus seek alternative or complementary medicine. However, there aren't any alternative therapies that have been shown to alter the course of lupus, although some may help ease symptoms of the disease. Discuss these treatments with your doctor before initiating them on your own. He or she can help you weigh the benefits and risks and tell you if the treatments will interfere adversely with your current lupus medications. Complementary and alternative treatments for lupus include: - Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA). Supplements containing this hormone may help fatigue and muscle pain. It may lead to acne in women. - Fish oil. Fish oil supplements contain omega-3 fatty acids that may be beneficial for people with lupus. Preliminary studies have found some promise, though more study is needed. Side effects of fish oil supplements can include nausea, belching and a fishy taste in the mouth. - Acupuncture. This therapy uses tiny needles inserted just under the skin. It may help ease the muscle pain associated with lupus."
how is asthma diagnosed,"Asthma (Diagnosis): Your primary care doctor will diagnose asthma based on your medical and family histories, a physical exam, and test results. Your doctor also will figure out the severity of your asthma—that is, whether it's intermittent, mild, moderate, or severe. The level of severity will determine what treatment you'll start on. You may need to see an asthma specialist if: You need special tests to help diagnose asthma You've had a life-threatening asthma attack You need more than one kind of medicine or higher doses of medicine to control your asthma, or if you have overall problems getting your asthma well controlled You're thinking about getting allergy treatments Medical and Family Histories Your doctor may ask about your family history of asthma and allergies. He or she also may ask whether you have asthma symptoms and when and how often they occur. Let your doctor know whether your symptoms seem to happen only during certain times of the year or in certain places, or if they get worse at night. Your doctor also may want to know what factors seem to trigger your symptoms or worsen them. For more information about possible asthma triggers, go to ""What Are the Signs and Symptoms of Asthma?"" Your doctor may ask you about related health conditions that can interfere with asthma management. These conditions include a runny nose, sinus infections, reflux disease, psychological stress, and sleep apnea. Physical Exam Your doctor will listen to your breathing and look for signs of asthma or allergies. These signs include wheezing, a runny nose or swollen nasal passages, and allergic skin conditions (such as eczema). Keep in mind that you can still have asthma even if you don't have these signs on the day that your doctor examines you. Diagnostic Tests Lung Function Test Your doctor will use a test called spirometry (spi-ROM-eh-tre) to check how your lungs are working. This test measures how much air you can breathe in and out. It also measures how fast you can blow air out. Your doctor also may give you medicine and then test you again to see whether the results have improved. If the starting results are lower than normal and improve with the medicine, and if your medical history shows a pattern of asthma symptoms, your diagnosis will likely be asthma. Other Tests Your doctor may recommend other tests if he or she needs more information to make a diagnosis. Other tests may include: Allergy testing to find out which allergens affect you, if any. A test to measure how sensitive your airways are. This is called a bronchoprovocation (brong-KO-prav-eh-KA-shun) test. Using spirometry, this test repeatedly measures your lung function during physical activity or after you receive increasing doses of cold air or a special chemical to breathe in. A test to show whether you have another condition with the same symptoms as asthma, such as reflux disease, vocal cord dysfunction, or sleep apnea. A chest x ray or an EKG (electrocardiogram). These tests will help find out whether a foreign object or other disease may be causing your symptoms. Diagnosing Asthma in Young Children Most children who have asthma develop their first symptoms before 5 years of age. However, asthma in young children (aged 0 to 5 years) can be hard to diagnose. Sometimes it's hard to tell whether a child has asthma or another childhood condition. This is because the symptoms of asthma also occur with other conditions. Also, many young children who wheeze when they get colds or respiratory infections don't go on to have asthma after they're 6 years old. A child may wheeze because he or she has small airways that become even narrower during colds or respiratory infections. The airways grow as the child grows older, so wheezing no longer occurs when the child gets colds. A young child who has frequent wheezing with colds or respiratory infections is more likely to have asthma if: One or both parents have asthma The child has signs of allergies, including the allergic skin condition eczema The child has allergic reactions to pollens or other airborne allergens The child wheezes even when he or she doesn't have a cold or other infection The most certain way to diagnose asthma is with a lung function test, a medical history, and a physical exam. However, it's hard to do lung function tests in children younger than 5 years. Thus, doctors must rely on children's medical histories, signs and symptoms, and physical exams to make a diagnosis. Doctors also may use a 4–6 week trial of asthma medicines to see how well a child responds."
how is congenital heart disease passed down,"Congenital heart disease (Causes): Congenital heart disease can describe a number of different problems affecting the heart. It is the most common type of birth defect. CHD causes more deaths in the first year of life than any other birth defects. Congenital heart disease is often divided into 2 types: cyanotic (blue skin color caused by a lack of oxygen) and non-cyanotic. The following lists cover the most common congenital heart diseases: Cyanotic: - Ebstein's anomaly - Hypoplastic left heart - Pulmonary atresia - Tetralogy of Fallot - Total anomalous pulmonary venous return - Transposition of the great vessels - Tricuspid atresia - Truncus arteriosus Non-cyanotic: - Aortic stenosis - Atrial septal defect (ASD) - Atrioventricular canal (endocardial cushion defect) - Coarctation of the aorta - Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) - Pulmonic stenosis - Ventricular septal defect (VSD) These problems may occur alone or together. Most children with CHD do not have other types of birth defects. However, heart defects may be part of genetic and chromosomal syndromes. Some of these syndromes may be passed down through families. Examples include: - DiGeorge syndrome - Down syndrome - Marfan syndrome - Noonan syndrome - Trisomy 13 - Turner syndrome Often, no cause for the heart disease can be found. Congenital heart diseases continue to be investigated and researched. Drugs such as retinoic acid for acne, chemicals, alcohol, and infections (such as rubella) during pregnancy can contribute to some congenital heart problems. Poorly controlled blood sugar in women who have diabetes during pregnancy has also been linked to a high rate of congenital heart defects."
how is congenital heart disease passed down,"Congenital heart disease in adults: Congenital mitral valve anomalies are defects present at birth (congenital) that affect the heart's mitral valve. The mitral valve is located between the heart's upper left chamber (left atrium) and lower left chamber (left ventricle). Various types of mitral valve anomalies exist, including: - Thickened, stiffened, deformed or fused valve flaps (leaflets) - Abnormalities with the cords that support the valve, such as short and thick cords, cords attaching to a heart muscle near the mitral valve, or missing cords - Heart tissue or heart muscle problems near the mitral valve These mitral valve anomalies can cause the mitral valve to not function normally. Some mitral valve anomalies may lead to mitral valve stenosis, in which the flaps become thick or stiff or fuse together. This causes a narrowed valve opening and reduced blood flow from the left atrium to the left ventricle. Other mitral valve anomalies may lead to mitral valve regurgitation, in which the flaps don't close tightly, causing blood to leak backward into the left atrium. Mitral valve regurgitation may also be caused by the flaps bulging backward into the left atrium as your heart contracts (mitral valve prolapse). In some cases, people may have both mitral valve stenosis and mitral valve regurgitation. Some people may have more than one opening in the area of the mitral valve, a condition called double-orifice mitral valve. In these people, one or both of the openings is often either narrowed (stenotic) or leaking (regurgitant). People with mitral valve anomalies also often have additional congenital heart defects. Your doctor may review your signs and symptoms, discuss your medical and family history, and conduct a physical exam. Your doctor may listen to your heart with a stethoscope to check for a heart murmur, which can be a sign of mitral valve disease. Congenital mitral valve anomalies are often diagnosed with an echocardiogram. An echocardiogram uses sound waves to produce video images of your heart in motion. This test can show the structure of the heart, the heart valves and blood flow through the heart. Doctors may use this test to evaluate whether mitral valve stenosis or mitral valve regurgitation is present. Other tests, such as a chest X-ray or electrocardiogram, may also be conducted. Congenital heart disease (congenital heart defect) is one or more abnormalities in your heart's structure that you're born with. This most common of birth defects can alter the way blood flows through your heart. Defects range from simple, which might cause no problems, to complex, which can cause life-threatening complications. Advances in diagnosis and treatment mean most babies who once died of congenital heart disease survive well into adulthood. However, signs and symptoms of the condition can occur in adults later in life, even those who had treatment as a child. If you have congenital heart disease you might need care throughout your life. Check with your doctor to determine how often you should be seen as an adult. Adult congenital heart disease care at Mayo Clinic Some congenital heart defects cause no signs or symptoms. For some people, signs or symptoms occur later in life. They can recur years after you've had treatment for a heart defect. Common congenital heart disease symptoms you might have as an adult include: - Abnormal heart rhythms (arrhythmias) - A bluish tint to the skin, lips and fingernails (cyanosis) - Shortness of breath - Tiring quickly upon exertion - Swelling of body tissue or organs (edema) If you're having worrisome symptoms, such as chest pain or shortness of breath, seek emergency medical attention. If you have signs or symptoms of congenital heart disease or were treated for a congenital heart defect as a child, make an appointment to see your doctor. Researchers aren't sure what causes most congenital heart disease, which develops in the womb. Heredity might play a role in some congenital heart disease. The heart is divided into two chambers on the right and two on the left. To pump blood through the body, the heart uses its left and right sides differently. The right side of the heart moves blood to the lungs through certain blood vessels (pulmonary arteries). In the lungs, blood picks up oxygen and then returns to the left side through the pulmonary veins. The left side of the heart then pumps the blood through the aorta and out to the rest of the body. Congenital heart disease can affect any of the heart's structures, including valves, chambers, the wall of tissue that separates the chambers (septum) and arteries. For some adults, problems with their heart defects arise later in life, even if treated in childhood. Repairing defects improves heart function, but might not make the heart completely normal. Even if the treatment you received in childhood was successful, a problem can occur or worsen as you age. It's also possible that problems in your heart, which weren't serious enough to repair when you were a child, have worsened and now require treatment. Then there are complications of childhood surgeries to correct congenital heart disease that can occur later, such as scar tissue in your heart that contributes to an abnormal heart rhythm (arrhythmia). Certain environmental and genetic risk factors might play a role in the development of your heart defect, including: - German measles (rubella). Your mother having had rubella while pregnant could have affected your heart development. - Diabetes. Your mother having type 1 or type 2 diabetes might have interfered with the development of your heart. Gestational diabetes generally doesn't increase the risk of developing a heart defect. - Medications. Taking certain medications while pregnant can cause congenital heart and other birth defects. They include isotretinoin (Amnesteem, Claravis, others), used to treat acne; and lithium, used to treat bipolar disorder. Drinking alcohol while pregnant also contributes to the risk of heart defects. - Heredity. Congenital heart disease appears to run in families and is associated with many genetic syndromes. For instance, children with Down syndrome often have heart defects. Genetic testing can detect Down syndrome and other disorders during a baby's development. - Smoking. A mother who smokes while pregnant increases her risk of having a child with a congenital heart defect. To determine whether you have a type of congenital heart disease or if the congenital heart defect is causing recent health problems, your doctor will take a medical history and conduct a physical exam, including listening to your heart with a stethoscope. Your doctor then might order tests, including: - Electrocardiogram (ECG). This measures the pace and amount of electrical activity of your heart to determine if the electrical activity is normal. An ECG can determine if a part of the heart is enlarged. - Chest X-ray. These images help your doctor further evaluate your heart and lungs. - Echocardiogram. Sound waves (ultrasound) produce images of the moving heart that your doctor can use to identify heart abnormalities. - Transesophageal echocardiogram. This special type of ultrasound produces images of your heart that provide more information than does a standard echocardiogram. While you're sedated, your doctor places an instrument with a small ultrasound probe on the end into the tube that connects your throat with your stomach (esophagus). - Pulse oximetry. A small sensor attached to a finger can estimate how much oxygen is in your blood. - Exercise stress test. Connected to ECG leads, you exercise on a treadmill or a stationary bicycle so that your doctor can determine your level of conditioning and your heart's electrical activity, heart rate and blood pressure during exercise. If you can't exercise, your doctor might give you medication to increase your heart rate. Your stress test may also include an echocardiogram and special sensors to determine your oxygen use. - Cardiac CT scan or MRI. For a cardiac CT scan, you lie on a table inside a doughnut-shaped machine. An X-ray tube inside the machine rotates around your body and collects images of your heart and chest. Cardiac MRI uses a magnetic field and radio waves to create images of your heart. You lie on a table inside a long tubelike machine. - Cardiac catheterization. Your doctor might use this test to check blood flow and blood pressures in your heart. You'll likely be given sleeping medication before a catheter is inserted into an artery, starting in your groin, neck or arm. It's then threaded to your heart with guidance from an X-ray machine. Dye is injected through the catheter, and the X-ray machine makes images of your heart and blood vessels. The pressure in the heart chambers can be measured during this procedure. Depending on the severity of your congenital heart disease, treatment might be aimed at correcting the congenital heart defect or dealing with complications caused by the defect. Treatment might include: - Watchful waiting. Relatively minor heart defects might require only periodic checkups with your doctor to make sure your condition doesn't worsen. Ask your doctor how often you need to be seen. - Medications. Some mild congenital heart defects can be treated with medications that help the heart work more efficiently. You might also need medications to prevent blood clots or to control an irregular heartbeat. - Implantable heart devices. Devices that help control your heart rate (pacemaker) or that correct life-threatening irregular heartbeats (implantable cardioverter-defibrillator, or ICD) can help some of the complications associated with congenital heart defects. - Special procedures using catheters. Some congenital heart defects can be repaired using catheterization techniques, which allow the repair to be done without surgically opening the chest and heart. In these procedures, the doctor inserts a thin tube (catheter) into a leg vein and guides it to the heart with the help of X-ray images. Once the catheter is in position, the doctor threads tiny tools through the catheter to repair the defect. - Open-heart surgery. If catheter procedures can't fix your heart defect, your doctor might recommend open-heart surgery. - Heart transplant. If a serious heart defect can't be repaired, a heart transplant might be an option. Needed follow-up care Many adults with congenital heart disease believe they've either outgrown their condition or that childhood treatment cured them. This might not be true, depending on the type of defect. If you have congenital heart disease, even if you had surgery as a child, you're at risk of developing complications. So it's important to have lifelong follow-up care, especially if you had corrective heart surgery. This follow-up care could be as simple as having periodic checkups with your doctor, or it may involve regular screenings for complications. The important thing is to discuss your care plan with your doctor and make sure you follow all of your doctor's recommendations. Ideally, a cardiologist trained in treating adults with congenital heart defects will manage your care. Congenital heart disease and pregnancy A successful pregnancy is possible if you have congenital heart disease, especially if your defect was mild. However, some women with complex congenital heart defects are advised against pregnancy. Before you become pregnant, discuss with your doctor possible risks and special care you might need during pregnancy. Both men and women with congenital heart disease are at increased risk of passing some form of congenital heart disease to their children. Your doctor might suggest genetic counseling if you plan to become pregnant."

Autoimmune hepatitis is a chronic—or long lasting—disease in which the body's immune system attacks the normal components, or cells, of the liver and causes inflammation and liver damage. The immune system normally protects people from infection by identifying and destroying bacteria, viruses, and other potentially harmful foreign substances. Autoimmune hepatitis is a serious condition that may worsen over time if not treated. Autoimmune hepatitis can lead to cirrhosis and liver failure. Cirrhosis occurs when scar tissue replaces healthy liver tissue and blocks the normal flow of blood through the liver. Liver failure occurs when the liver stops working properly. What are autoimmune diseases? Autoimmune diseases are disorders in which the body's immune system attacks the body's own cells and organs with proteins called autoantibodies; this process is called autoimmunity. Autoimmune hepatitis is a chronic disease of the liver. The body's immune system normally makes large numbers of proteins called antibodies to help the body fight off infections. In some cases, however, the body makes autoantibodies. Certain environmental triggers can lead to autoimmunity. Environmental triggers are things originating outside the body, such as bacteria, viruses, toxins, and medications. What causes autoimmune hepatitis? A combination of autoimmunity, environmental triggers, and a genetic predisposition can lead to autoimmune hepatitis. Who is more likely to develop autoimmune hepatitis? Autoimmune hepatitis is more common in females.1 The disease can occur at any age and affects all ethnic groups. What are the types of autoimmune hepatitis? Autoimmune hepatitis is classified into several types. Type 1 autoimmune hepatitis is the most common form in North America. Type 1 can occur at any age; however, it most often starts in adolescence or young adulthood. About 70 percent of people with type 1 autoimmune hepatitis are female.1 People with type 1 autoimmune hepatitis commonly have other autoimmune disorders, such as celiac disease, an autoimmune disease in which people cannot tolerate gluten because it damages the lining of their small intestine and prevents absorption of nutrients Crohn's disease, which causes inflammation and irritation of any part of the digestive tract Graves' disease, the most common cause of hyperthyroidism in the United States Hashimoto's disease, also called chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis or autoimmune thyroiditis, a form of chronic inflammation of the thyroid gland proliferative glomerulonephritis, or inflammation of the glomeruli, which are tiny clusters of looping blood vessels in the kidneys primary sclerosing cholangitis, which causes irritation, scarring, and narrowing of the bile ducts inside and outside the liver rheumatoid arthritis, which causes pain, swelling, stiffness, and loss of function in the joints Sjögren's syndrome, which causes dryness in the mouth and eyes systemic lupus erythematosus, which causes kidney inflammation called lupus nephritis type 1 diabetes, a condition characterized by high blood glucose, also called blood sugar, levels caused by a total lack of insulin ulcerative colitis, a chronic disease that causes inflammation and sores, called ulcers, in the inner lining of the large intestine Type 2 autoimmune hepatitis is less common and occurs more often in children than adults.1 People with type 2 can also have any of the above autoimmune disorders. What are the symptoms of autoimmune hepatitis? The most common symptoms of autoimmune hepatitis are fatigue joint pain nausea loss of appetite pain or discomfort over the liver skin rashes dark yellow urine light-colored stools jaundice, or yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes Symptoms of autoimmune hepatitis range from mild to severe. Some people may feel as if they have a mild case of the flu. Others may have no symptoms when a health care provider diagnoses the disease; however, they can develop symptoms later. How is autoimmune hepatitis diagnosed? A health care provider will make a diagnosis of autoimmune hepatitis based on symptoms, a physical exam, blood tests, and a liver biopsy. A health care provider performs a physical exam and reviews the person's health history, including the use of alcohol and medications that can harm the liver. A person usually needs blood tests for an exact diagnosis because a person with autoimmune hepatitis can have the same symptoms as those of other liver diseases or metabolic disorders. Blood tests. A blood test involves drawing blood at a health care provider's office or a commercial facility and sending the sample to a lab for analysis. A person will need blood tests for autoantibodies to help distinguish autoimmune hepatitis from other liver diseases that have similar symptoms, such as viral hepatitis, primary biliary cirrhosis, steatohepatitis, or Wilson disease. Liver biopsy. A liver biopsy is a procedure that involves taking a piece of liver tissue for examination with a microscope for signs of damage or disease. The health care provider may ask the patient to temporarily stop taking certain medications before the liver biopsy. He or she may also ask the patient to fast for 8 hours before the procedure. During the procedure, the patient lies on a table, right hand resting above the head. A health care provider will apply a local anesthetic to the area where he or she will insert the biopsy needle. If needed, he or she will give sedatives and pain medication. Then, he or she will use a needle to take a small piece of liver tissue, and may use ultrasound, computerized tomography scans, or other imaging techniques to guide the needle. After the biopsy, the patient must lie on the right side for up to 2 hours and is monitored an additional 2 to 4 hours before being sent home. A health care provider performs a liver biopsy at a hospital or an outpatient center. The liver sample is sent to a pathology lab where the pathologist—a doctor who specializes in diagnosing disease—looks at the tissue with a microscope and sends a report to the patient's health care provider. A health care provider can use liver biopsy to diagnose autoimmune hepatitis and determine if cirrhosis is present. People often have cirrhosis at the time they are diagnosed with autoimmune hepatitis. A health care provider can also use liver biopsy to look for changes in the severity of liver damage prior to ending treatment for autoimmune hepatitis. How is autoimmune hepatitis treated? Treatment for autoimmune hepatitis includes medication to suppress, or slow down, an overactive immune system. Treatment may also include a liver transplant. Treatment works best when autoimmune hepatitis is diagnosed early. People with autoimmune hepatitis generally respond to standard treatment and the disease can be controlled in most cases. Long-term response to treatment can stop the disease from getting worse and may even reverse some damage to the liver. Medications People with autoimmune hepatitis who have no symptoms or a mild form of the disease may or may not need to take medication. A health care provider will determine if a person needs treatment. In some people with mild autoimmune hepatitis, the disease may go into remission. Remission is a period when a person is symptom-free and blood tests and liver biopsy show improvement in liver function. Corticosteroids. Corticosteroids are medications that decrease swelling and reduce the activity of the immune system. Health care providers treat both types of autoimmune hepatitis with a daily dose of a corticosteroid called prednisone. Treatment may begin with a high dose that is gradually lowered as the disease is controlled. The treatment goal is to find the lowest possible dose that helps control the disease. Side effects of prednisone may include weight gain weakness of the bones, called osteoporosis or osteomalacia thinning of the hair and skin acne diabetes high blood pressure cataracts, a clouding in the lens of the eyes glaucoma, elevated pressure in the eyes anxiety and confusion A health care provider will closely monitor and manage any side effects that may occur, as high doses of prednisone are often prescribed to treat autoimmune hepatitis. Immune system suppressors. Medications that suppress the immune system prevent the body from making autoantibodies and block the immune reaction that contributes to inflammation. In most cases, health care providers use azathioprine (Azasan, Imuran) in conjunction with prednisone to treat autoimmune hepatitis. When using azathioprine, a health care provider can use a lower dose of prednisone, which may reduce prednisone's side effects. Side effects of azathioprine include low white blood cell count nausea vomiting skin rash liver damage pancreatitis, or inflammation of the pancreas Azathioprine is an immune system suppressor, so people taking the medication should undergo routine blood tests to monitor their white blood cell counts. A low white blood cell count can lead to bone marrow failure. Bone marrow is the tissue found inside bones that produces new blood cells, including platelets. A health care provider will also check the platelet count when blood tests are done. A person may need to discontinue prednisone or azathioprine if they cause severe side effects. The risk of side effects is higher in people who also have cirrhosis. A health care provider may gradually reduce the dose of medication in people who show improvement, although the symptoms can return. When a person discontinues treatment, a health care provider will perform routine blood tests and carefully monitor the person's condition for a return of symptoms. Treatment with low doses of prednisone or azathioprine may be necessary on and off for many years. People who do not respond to standard immune therapy or who have severe side effects from the medications may benefit from other immunosuppressive agents such as mycophenolate mofetil (CellCept), cyclosporine, or tacrolimus (Hecoria, Prograf). Medications that suppress the immune system may lead to various forms of cancer. People on low doses of azathioprine for long periods of time are at slight risk of developing cancer. Liver Transplant In some people, autoimmune hepatitis progresses to cirrhosis and end-stage liver failure, and a liver transplant may be necessary. Symptoms of cirrhosis and liver failure include the symptoms of autoimmune hepatitis and generalized itching a longer-than-usual amount of time for bleeding to stop easy bruising a swollen stomach or swollen ankles spiderlike blood vessels, called spider angiomas, that develop on the skin abdominal bloating due to an enlarged liver fluid in the abdomen—also called ascites forgetfulness or confusion Liver transplant is surgery to remove a diseased or an injured liver and replace it with a healthy one from another person, called a donor. A team of surgeons performs a liver transplant in a hospital. When possible, the patient fasts for 8 hours before the surgery. The patient stays in the hospital about 1 to 2 weeks to be sure the transplanted liver is functioning properly. The health care provider will monitor the patient for bleeding, infections, and signs of liver rejection. The patient will take prescription medications long term to prevent infections and rejection. Liver transplant surgery for autoimmune hepatitis is successful in most cases. More information is provided in the NIDDK health topic, Liver Transplantation. What is a possible complication of autoimmune hepatitis and cirrhosis? People with autoimmune hepatitis and cirrhosis are at risk of developing liver cancer. A health care provider will monitor the person with a regular ultrasound examination of the liver. Ultrasound uses a device, called a transducer, that bounces safe, painless sound waves off organs to create an image of their structure. A specially trained technician performs the procedure in a health care provider's office, an outpatient center, or a hospital, and a radiologist—a doctor who specializes in medical imaging—interprets the images; anesthesia is not needed. The images can show the liver's size and the presence of cancerous tumors. Eating, Diet, and Nutrition Researchers have not found that eating, diet, and nutrition play a role in causing or preventing autoimmune hepatitis. Points to Remember Autoimmune hepatitis is a chronic—or long lasting—disease in which the body's immune system attacks the liver and causes inflammation and damage.

what is the cause of congenital heart defects,"Congenital heart defects in children (Risk factors): Most congenital heart defects result from problems early in your child's heart development, the cause of which is unknown. However, certain environmental and genetic risk factors may play a role. They include: - Rubella (German measles). Having rubella during pregnancy can cause problems in your baby's heart development. Your doctor can test you for immunity to this viral disease before pregnancy and vaccinate you against it if you aren't immune. - Diabetes. You can reduce the risk of congenital heart defects by carefully controlling your diabetes before attempting to conceive and during pregnancy. Gestational diabetes generally doesn't increase your baby's risk of developing a heart defect. - Medications. Certain medications taken during pregnancy may cause birth defects, including congenital heart defects. Give your doctor a complete list of medications you take before attempting to become pregnant. Medications known to increase the risk of congenital heart defects include thalidomide (Thalomid), angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, statins, the acne medication isotretinoin (Absorica, Amnesteem, Claravis) and lithium. - Drinking alcohol during pregnancy. Avoid alcohol during pregnancy because it increases the risk of congenital heart defects. - Smoking. Smoking during pregnancy increases the likelihood of a congenital heart defect in the baby. - Heredity. Congenital heart defects sometimes run in families and may be associated with a genetic syndrome. Many children with Down syndrome - which is caused by an extra 21st chromosome (trisomy 21) - have heart defects. A missing piece (deletion) of genetic material on chromosome 22 also causes heart defects. Genetic testing can detect such disorders during fetal development. If you already have a child with a congenital heart defect, a genetic counselor can estimate the odds that your next child will have one."
what treatment do you use to cure chickenpox,"What are the treatments for Chickenpox?: Treatment involves keeping the person as comfortable as possible. Here are things to try: - Avoid scratching or rubbing the itchy areas. Keep fingernails short to avoid damaging the skin from scratching. - Wear cool, light, loose bedclothes. Avoid wearing rough clothing, particularly wool, over an itchy area. - Take lukewarm baths using little soap and rinse thoroughly. Try a skin-soothing oatmeal or cornstarch bath. - Apply a soothing moisturizer after bathing to soften and cool the skin. - Avoid prolonged exposure to excessive heat and humidity. - Try over-the-counter oral antihistamines such as diphenhydramine (Benadryl), but be aware of possible side effects, such as drowsiness. - Try over-the-counter hydrocortisone cream on itchy areas. Medicines that fight the chickenpox virus are available, but not given to everyone. To work well, the medicine should be started within the first 24 hours of the rash. - Antiviral drugs are not very often prescribed to otherwise healthy children who do not have severe symptoms. Adults and teens, who are at risk for more severe symptoms, may benefit from antiviral medicine if it is given early. - Antiviral medicine may be very important forthose who have skin conditions (such as eczema or recent sunburn), lung conditions (such as asthma), or who have recently taken steroids. - Some providers also give antiviral medicines to people in the same household who also develop chickenpox, because they will most often develop more severe symptoms. Do NOT give aspirin or ibuprofen to someone who may have chickenpox. Use of aspirin has been associated with a serious condition called Reyes syndrome. Ibuprofen has been associated with more severe secondary infections. Acetaminophen (Tylenol) may be used. A child with chickenpox should not return to school or play with other children until all chickenpox sores have crusted over or dried out. Adults should follow this same rule while considering when to return to work or be around others."
why can you not take grapefruit with felodipine,"What is Grapefruit?: Grapefruit is a citrus fruit. People use the fruit, oil from the peel, and extracts from the seed as medicine. Grapefruit seed extract is processed from grapefruit seeds and pulp obtained as a byproduct from grapefruit juice production. Vegetable glycerin is added to the final product to reduce acidity and bitterness. Grapefruit juice is used for high cholesterol, hardening of the arteries (atherosclerosis), cancer, a skin disease called psoriasis, and for weight loss and obesity. Grapefruit seed extract is taken by mouth for bacterial, viral, and fungal infections including yeast infections. Grapefruit oil is applied to the skin for muscle fatigue, hair growth, toning the skin, and for acne and oily skin. It is also used for the common cold and flu (influenza). Grapefruit seed extract is applied to the skin as a facial cleanser, first-aid treatment, remedy for mild skin irritations, and as a vaginal douche for vaginal yeast infections (candidiasis). It is also used as an ear or nasal rinse for preventing and treating infections; as a gargle for sore throats; and a dental rinse for preventing gingivitis and promoting healthy gums; and as a breath freshener. Some people inhale grapefruit vapors to help the body retain water, for headache, stress, and depression. Grapefruit seed extract vapor has also been inhaled for the treatment of lung infections. In food and beverages, grapefruit is consumed as a fruit, juice, and is used as a flavoring component. In manufacturing, grapefruit oil and seed extract are used as a fragrance component in soaps and cosmetics; and as a household cleaner for fruits, vegetables, meats, kitchen surfaces, dishes, etc. In agriculture, grapefruit seed extract is used to kill bacteria and fungus, fight mold growth, kill parasites in animal feeds, preserve food and disinfect water. Its important to remember that drug interactions with grapefruit juice are well documented. The chemistry of the grapefruit varies by the species, the growing conditions, and the process used to extract the juice. Before adding grapefruit to your diet or your list of natural medicines, check with your healthcare provider if you take medications."
can i take keflex to cure staph?,"Staph infections: Staph infections are caused by staphylococcus bacteria, types of germs commonly found on the skin or in the nose of even healthy individuals. Most of the time, these bacteria cause no problems or result in relatively minor skin infections. But staph infections can turn deadly if the bacteria invade deeper into your body, entering your bloodstream, joints, bones, lungs or heart. A growing number of otherwise healthy people are developing life-threatening staph infections. Treatment usually involves antibiotics and drainage of the infected area. However, some staph infections no longer respond to common antibiotics. Staph infections can range from minor skin problems to endocarditis, a life-threatening infection of the inner lining of your heart (endocardium). As a result, signs and symptoms of staph infections vary widely, depending on the location and severity of the infection. Skin infections caused by staph bacteria include: - Boils. The most common type of staph infection is the boil, a pocket of pus that develops in a hair follicle or oil gland. The skin over the infected area usually becomes red and swollen. If a boil breaks open, it will probably drain pus. Boils occur most often under the arms or around the groin or buttocks. - Impetigo. This contagious, often painful rash can be caused by staph bacteria. Impetigo usually features large blisters that may ooze fluid and develop a honey-colored crust. - Cellulitis. Cellulitis - an infection of the deeper layers of skin - causes skin redness and swelling on the surface of your skin. Sores (ulcers) or areas of oozing discharge may develop, too. - Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome. Toxins produced as a result of a staph infection may lead to staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome. Affecting mostly babies and children, this condition features fever, a rash and sometimes blisters. When the blisters break, the top layer of skin comes off - leaving a red, raw surface that looks like a burn. Staph bacteria are one of the most common causes of food poisoning. Symptoms come on quickly, usually within hours of eating a contaminated food. Symptoms usually disappear quickly, too, often lasting just half a day. A staph infection in food usually doesn't cause a fever. Signs and symptoms you can expect with this type of staph infection include: - Nausea and vomiting - Diarrhea - Dehydration - Low blood pressure Also known as blood poisoning, septicemia occurs when staph bacteria enter a person's bloodstream. A fever and low blood pressure are signs of septicemia. The bacteria can travel to locations deep within your body, to produce infections affecting: - Internal organs, such as your brain, heart or lungs - Bones and muscles - Surgically implanted devices, such as artificial joints or cardiac pacemakers This life-threatening condition results from toxins produced by some strains of staph bacteria and has been linked to certain types of tampons, skin wounds and surgery. It usually develops suddenly with: - A high fever - Nausea and vomiting - A rash on your palms and soles that resembles sunburn - Confusion - Muscle aches - Diarrhea - Abdominal pain Septic arthritis is often caused by a staph infection. The bacteria often target the knees, shoulders, hips, and fingers or toes. Signs and symptoms may include: - Joint swelling - Severe pain in the affected joint - Fever Go to the doctor if you or your child has: - An area of red, irritated or painful skin - Pus-filled blisters - Fever You may also want to consult your doctor if: - Skin infections are being passed from one family member to another - Two or more family members have skin infections at the same time Many people carry staph bacteria and never develop staph infections. However, if you develop a staph infection, there's a good chance that it's from bacteria you've been carrying around for some time. These bacteria can also be transmitted from person to person. Because staph bacteria are so hardy, they can live on inanimate objects such as pillowcases or towels long enough to transfer to the next person who touches them. Staph bacteria are able to survive: - Drying - Extremes of temperature - Stomach acid - High levels of salt A variety of factors - including the status of your immune system to the types of sports you play - can increase your risk of developing staph infections. Certain disorders or the medications used to treat them can make you more susceptible to staph infections. People who may be more likely to get a staph infection include those with: - Diabetes who use insulin - HIV/AIDS - Kidney failure requiring dialysis - Weakened immune systems - either from a disease or medications that suppress the immune system - Cancer, especially those who are undergoing chemotherapy or radiation - Skin damage from conditions such as eczema, insect bites or minor trauma that opens the skin - Respiratory illness, such as cystic fibrosis or emphysema Despite vigorous attempts to eradicate them, staph bacteria remain present in hospitals, where they attack the most vulnerable, including people with: - Weakened immune systems - Burns - Surgical wounds Staph bacteria can travel along the medical tubing that connects the outside world with your internal organs. Examples include: - Dialysis tubing - Urinary catheters - Feeding tubes - Breathing tubes - Intravascular catheters Staph bacteria can spread easily through cuts, abrasions and skin-to-skin contact. Staph infections may also spread in the locker room through shared razors, towels, uniforms or equipment. Food handlers who don't properly wash their hands can transfer staph from their skin to the food they're preparing. Foods that are contaminated with staph look and taste normal. If staph bacteria invade your bloodstream, you may develop a type of infection that affects your entire body. Called sepsis, this infection can lead to septic shock - a life-threatening episode with extremely low blood pressure. To diagnose a staph infection, your doctor will: - Perform a physical exam. During the exam, your doctor will closely examine any skin lesions you may have. - Collect a sample for testing. Most often, doctors diagnose staph infections by checking a tissue sample or nasal secretions for signs of the bacteria. Treatment of a staph infection may include: - Antibiotics. Your doctor may perform tests to identify of the staph bacteria behind your infection, and to help choose the antibiotic that will work best. Antibiotics commonly prescribed to treat staph infections include certain cephalosporins, nafcillin or related antibiotics, sulfa drugs, or vancomycin. Vancomycin increasingly is required to treat serious staph infections because so many strains of staph bacteria have become resistant to other traditional medicines. But vancomycin and some other antibiotics have to be given intravenously. If you're given an oral antibiotic, be sure to take it as directed, and to finish all of the medication prescribed by your doctor. Ask your doctor what signs and symptoms you should watch for that might indicate your infection is worsening. - Wound drainage. If you have a skin infection, your doctor will likely make an incision into the sore to drain fluid that has collected there. - Device removal. If your infection involves a device or prosthetic, prompt removal of the device is needed. For some devices, removal might require surgery. Antibiotic resistance Staph bacteria are very adaptable, and many varieties have become resistant to one or more antibiotics. For example, only about 10 percent of today's staph infections can be cured with penicillin. The emergence of antibiotic-resistant strains of staph bacteria - often described as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) strains - has led to the use of IV antibiotics, such as vancomycin, with the potential for more side effects, such as vancomycin."
"symptoms and diagnosis. My son is being tested now to see if he has hnpp and after reading about the disease, it occurred to me that all my trouble with my hands could have been this and not arthritis. I have had both hands operated on several times, with some success, but continue with swelling in my hands and feet/ankles and soreness and stiffness. Would it be easy to think a patient has arthritis?","Psoriatic arthritis: Psoriatic arthritis is a joint problem (arthritis) that often occurs with a skin condition called psoriasis. Psoriasis is a common skin problem that causes red patches on the body. It is an ongoing (chronic) inflammatory condition. About 1 in 20 people with psoriasis may develop arthritis with the skin condition. Nail psoriasis is linked to psoriatic arthritis. In most cases, psoriasis comes before the arthritis. The cause of psoriatic arthritis is not known. Genes, immune system, and environmental factors may play a role. It is likely that the skin and joint diseases may have similar causes. However, they may not occur together. The arthritis may be mild and involve only a few joints. The joints at the end of the fingers or toes may be more affected. In some people the disease may be severe and affect many joints, including the spine. Symptoms in the spine include stiffness, burning, and pain. They most often occur in the lower spine and sacrum. Most of the time, people with psoriatic arthritis have the skin and nail changes of psoriasis. Often, the skin gets worse at the same time as the arthritis. During a physical exam, the health care provider will look for: - Joint swelling - Skin patches (psoriasis) and pitting in the nails - Tenderness Joint x-rays may be done. There are no specific blood tests for psoriatic arthritis or for psoriasis, but the doctor may test for a gene called HLA-B27. Your provider may prescribe nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) to reduce pain and swelling of the joints. Worse arthritis will need to be treated with more powerful drugs called disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). These include: - Leflunomide - Methotrexate - Sulfasalazine New medicines that block an inflammatory protein called tumor necrosis factor (TNF) are being widely used for progressive psoriatic arthritis. These drugs include: - Adalimumab (Humira) - Certolizumab (Cimzia) - Etanercept (Enbrel) - Golimumab (Simponi) - Infliximab (Remicade) Very painful joints may be injected with steroid medicines. In rare cases, surgery may be needed to repair or replace damaged joints. Your provider may suggest a mix of rest and exercise. Physical therapy may help increase joint movement. You may also use heat and cold therapy. The disease is often mild and affects only a few joints. In some people, very bad psoriatic arthritis may cause deformities in the hands, feet, and spine. Early treatment can ease pain and prevent joint damage even in very bad cases. Call your provider if arthritis symptoms develop along with psoriasis. Updated by: Gordon A.

estradiol 75g patch. Can I stop using the patch only been on it 4.5 months,"Ethinyl Estradiol and Norelgestromin Transdermal Patch: Cigarette smoking increases the risk of serious side effects from the contraceptive patch, including heart attacks, blood clots, and strokes. This risk is higher for women over 35 years old and heavy smokers (15 or more cigarettes per day). If you use the contraceptive patch, you should not smoke. Ethinyl estradiol and norelgestromin transdermal system (patch) is used to prevent pregnancy. Norelgestromin is a progestin and ethinyl estradiol is an estrogen. Estrogen and progestin are two female sex hormones. Ethinyl estradiol and norelgestromin contraceptive patch works by preventing ovulation (the release of eggs from the ovaries) and by changing the cervical mucus and the lining of the uterus. The contraceptive patch is a very effective method of birth control, but it does not prevent the spread of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV; the virus that causes acquired immunodeficiency syndrome [AIDS]) and other sexually transmitted diseases. Ethinyl estradiol and norelgestromin transdermal system comes as a patch to apply to the skin. One patch is applied once a week for 3 weeks, followed by a patch-free week. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use the contraceptive patch exactly as directed. If you are just starting to use the contraceptive patch, you may apply your first patch on the first day of your menstrual period or the first Sunday after your period begins. If you apply your first patch after the first day of your menstrual period, you must use a backup method of birth control (such as a condom and/or a spermicide) for the first 7 days of the first cycle. Always apply your new patch on the same day of the week (the Patch Change Day). Apply a new patch once a week for 3 weeks. During Week 4, remove the old patch but do not apply a new patch, and expect to begin your menstrual period. On the day after Week 4 ends, apply a new patch to start a new 4-week cycle even if your menstrual period has not started or has not ended. You should not go more than 7 days without a patch. Apply the contraceptive patch to a clean, dry, intact, healthy area of skin on the buttock, abdomen, upper outer arm, or upper torso, in a place where it will not be rubbed by tight clothing. Do not place the contraceptive patch on the breasts or on skin that is red, irritated, or cut. Do not apply makeup, creams, lotions, powders, or other topical products to the skin area where the contraceptive patch is placed. Each new patch should be applied to a new spot on the skin to help avoid irritation. Do not cut, decorate, or change the patch in any way. Do not use extra tape, glue, or wraps to hold the patch in place. To use the contraceptive patch, follow these steps: - Open the foil pouch by tearing it along the edge. - Peel apart the foil pouch and open it flat. - Use your fingernail to lift one corner of the patch and peel the patch and its clear plastic liner off the foil liner. Sometimes patches can stick to the inside of the pouch; be careful not to remove the clear liner as you remove the patch. - Peel away half of the plastic liner. Avoid touching the sticky surface of the patch. - Apply the sticky surface of the patch to the skin and remove the other half of the plastic liner. Press down firmly on the patch with the palm of your hand for 10 seconds, making sure that the edges stick well. - After one week, remove the patch from your skin. Fold the used patch in half so that it sticks to itself and dispose of it so that it is out of the reach of children and pets. Do not flush the used patch down the toilet. Check your patch every day to make sure it is sticking. If the patch has been partially or completely detached for less than one day, try to reapply it in the same place immediately. Do not try to reapply a patch that is no longer sticky, that has stuck to itself or another surface, that has any material stuck to its surface or that has loosened or fallen off before. Apply a new patch instead. Your Patch Change Day will stay the same. If the patch has been partially or completely detached for more than one day, or if you do not know how long the patch has been detached, you may not be protected from pregnancy. You must start a new cycle by applying a new patch immediately; the day that you apply the new patch becomes your new Patch Change Day. Use backup birth control for the first week of the new cycle. If the skin under your patch becomes irritated, you may remove the patch and apply a new patch to a different spot on the skin. Leave the new patch in place until your regular Patch Change Day. Be sure to remove the old patch because you should never wear more than one patch at a time. Ask your pharmacist or doctor for a copy of the manufacturer's information for the patient. This medication may be prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information. Before using ethinyl estradiol and norelgestromin contraceptive patch, - tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to estrogens, progestins, or any other medications. - tell your doctor if you are using any other type of hormonal birth control, such as pills, rings, injections, or implants. Your doctor will tell you how and when you should stop using the other type of birth control and start using the contraceptive patch. Do not use any other type of hormonal birth control while you are using the contraceptive patch. - tell your doctor and pharmacist what prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, and nutritional supplements you are taking. Be sure to mention any of the following: acetaminophen (APAP, Tylenol); antibiotics such as ampicillin; anticoagulants ('blood thinners') such as warfarin (Coumadin); antifungals such as itraconazole (Sporanox) and ketoconazole (Nizoral); ascorbic acid (vitamin C); atorvastatin (Lipitor); clofibrate ; cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune); griseofulvin (Fulvicin, Grifulvin, Grisactin); HIV protease inhibitors such as indinavir (Crixivan) and ritonavir (Norvir); medications for seizures such as carbamazepine (Tegretol), felbamate (Felbatol), phenobarbital (Luminal, Solfoton), oxcarbazepine (Trileptal), phenytoin (Dilantin), and topiramate (Topamax); morphine (Kadian, MS Contin, MSIR, others); oral steroids such as dexamethasone (Decadron, Dexone), methylprednisolone (Medrol), prednisone (Deltasone), and prednisolone (Prelone); rifampin (Rifadin, Rimactane); temazepam (Restoril); theophylline (Theobid, Theo-Dur); and thyroid medication such as levothyroxine (Levothroid, Levoxyl, Synthroid). Your doctor may need to change the doses of your medications or monitor you carefully for side effects. - tell your doctor what herbal products you are taking, especially products containing St. John's wort. - tell your doctor if you have recently had surgery or if you are on bedrest. Also tell your doctor if you have or have ever had a heart attack; a stroke; blood clots in your legs, lungs, or eyes; chest pain due to heart disease; cancer of the breasts, lining of the uterus, cervix, or vagina; vaginal bleeding between menstrual periods; hepatitis (swelling of the liver); yellowing of the skin or eyes, especially while you were pregnant or using hormonal contraceptives; a liver tumor; headaches that happen with other symptoms such as weakness or difficulty seeing or moving; high blood pressure; diabetes that has caused problems with your kidneys, eyes, nerves, or blood vessels; or heart valve disease. Your doctor will probably tell you that you should not use the contraceptive patch. - tell your doctor if you have recently given birth or had a miscarriage or abortion and if you weigh 198 lbs or more. Also tell your doctor if anyone in your family has ever had breast cancer and if you have or have ever had breast lumps, fibrocystic disease of the breast (condition in which lumps or masses that are not cancer form in the breasts) or an abnormal mammogram (x-ray of the breasts). Also tell your doctor if you have or have ever had high blood cholesterol and fats; diabetes; asthma; migraines or other types of headaches; depression; seizures; scanty or irregular menstrual periods; or liver, heart, gallbladder, or kidney disease. - tell your doctor if you are pregnant, plan to become pregnant, or are breast-feeding. If you become pregnant while using ethinyl estradiol and norelgestromin contraceptive patch, call your doctor immediately. You should suspect that you are pregnant and call your doctor if you have used the contraceptive patch correctly and you have missed two periods in a row, or if you have not used the contraceptive patch correctly and you have missed one period. - if you are having surgery, including dental surgery, tell the doctor or dentist that you are using ethinyl estradiol and norelgestromin contraceptive patch. Talk to your doctor about this as soon as your surgery is scheduled because your doctor may want you to stop using the contraceptive patch several weeks before your surgery. - tell your doctor if you wear contact lenses. If you notice changes in your vision or ability to wear your lenses while using ethinyl estradiol and norelgestromin contraceptive patch, see an eye doctor. - you should know that when you use the contraceptive patch, the average amount of estrogen in your blood will be higher than it would be if you used an oral contraceptive (birth control pill), and this may increase the risk of serious side effects such as blood clots in the legs or lungs. Three studies were done to learn more about this risk. Two studies found that women who used contraceptive patches were more likely to develop blood clots than women who used oral contraceptives. The other study found that women who used contraceptive patches were no more likely to develop blood clots than women who used oral contraceptives. Talk to your doctor about the risks of using the contraceptive patch. Unless your doctor tells you otherwise, continue your normal diet. If you forget to apply your patch at the start of any patch cycle (Week 1, Day 1), you may not be protected from pregnancy. Apply the first patch of the new cycle as soon as you remember. There is now a new Patch Change Day and a new Day 1. Use a backup method of birth control for one week. If you forget to change your patch in the middle of the patch cycle (Week 2 or Week 3) for 1 or 2 days, apply a new patch immediately and apply the next patch on your usual Patch Change Day. If you forget to change your patch in the middle of the cycle for more than 2 days, you may not be protected from pregnancy. Stop the current cycle and start a new cycle immediately by applying a new patch. There is now a new Patch Change Day and a new Day 1. Use a backup method of birth control for 1 week. If you forget to remove your patch at the end of the patch cycle (Week 4), take it off as soon as you remember. Start the next cycle on the usual Patch Change Day, the day after Day 28. Ethinyl estradiol and norelgestromin contraceptive patch may cause side effects. Tell your doctor if any of these symptoms are severe or do not go away: - irritation, redness, or rash in the place where you applied the patch - breast tenderness, enlargement, or discharge - nausea - vomiting - stomach cramps or bloating - weight gain or weight loss - change in appetite - brown or black skin patches - acne - swelling of the hands, feet, ankles, or lower legs - hair loss - bleeding or spotting between menstrual periods - changes in menstrual flow - painful or missed periods - vaginal itching or irritation - white vaginal discharge - difficulty wearing contact lenses Some side effects can be serious. If you experience any of the following symptoms, call your doctor immediately: - sudden severe headache or vomiting - speech problems - dizziness or faintness - weakness or numbness of an arm or leg - sudden partial or complete loss of vision - double vision - bulging eyes - sharp or crushing chest pain - chest tightness - coughing up blood - shortness of breath - calf pain - severe stomach pain - sleep problems, mood changes, and other signs of depression - yellowing of the skin or eyes - unusual bleeding - loss of appetite - extreme tiredness, weakness, or lack of energy - fever - dark-colored urine - light-colored stool - rash Ethinyl estradiol and norelgestromin contraceptive patch may increase the risk of developing endometrial and breast cancer, gallbladder disease, liver tumors, heart attack, stroke, and blood clots. Talk to your doctor about the risks of using this medication. Ethinyl estradiol and norelgestromin contraceptive patch may cause other side effects. Call your doctor if you have any unusual problems while using this medication. If you experience a serious side effect, you or your doctor may send a report to the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) MedWatch Adverse Event Reporting program online (http://www.fda.gov/Safety/MedWatch) or by phone (1-800-332-1088). Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them. However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community. See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website (http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program. It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location – one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach. http://www.upandaway.org In case of overdose, remove all the patches that were applied and call your local poison control center at 1-800-222-1222. If the victim has collapsed or is not breathing, call local emergency services at 911. Keep all appointments with your doctor and the laboratory. You should have a complete physical examination every year, including blood pressure measurements, breast and pelvic exams, and a Pap test. Follow your doctor's directions for examining your breasts; report any lumps immediately. Before you have any laboratory tests, tell the laboratory personnel that you use ethinyl estradiol and norelgestromin contraceptive patch, as this medication may interfere with some laboratory tests. Do not let anyone else use your medication. Ask your pharmacist any questions you have about refilling your prescription. It is important for you to keep a written list of all of the prescription and nonprescription (over-the-counter) medicines you are taking, as well as any products such as vitamins, minerals, or other dietary supplements. You should bring this list with you each time you visit a doctor or if you are admitted to a hospital. It is also important information to carry with you in case of emergencies. - Ortho Evra® (containing Ethinyl Estradiol, Norelgestromin)"
"Ear Wax.. I sometimes drop Peroxide into the ear and let it bubble for a couple of minutes, then use warm water to flush it out. is there harm?","Swimmer's ear: Swimmer's ear is inflammation, irritation, or infection of the outer ear and ear canal. The medical term for swimmer's ear is otitis externa. Swimmer's ear may be sudden and short-term (acute) or long-term (chronic). Swimmer's ear is more common among children in their teens and young adults. It may occur with a middle ear infection or a respiratory infection such as a cold. Swimming in unclean water can lead to swimmer's ear. Bacteria commonly often found in water can cause ear infections. Rarely, the infection may be caused by a fungus. Other causes of swimmer's ear include: - Scratching the ear or inside the ear - Getting something stuck in the ear Trying to clean (wax from the ear canal) with cotton swabs or small objects can damage the skin. Long-term (chronic) swimmer's ear may be due to: - Allergic reaction to something placed in the ear - Chronic skin conditions, such as eczema or psoriasis Symptoms of swimmer's ear include: - Drainage from the ear -- yellow, yellow-green, pus-like, or foul smelling - Ear pain, which may get worse when you pull on the outer ear - Hearing loss - Itching of the ear or ear canal The health care provider will look inside your ears. The ear canal area will look red and swollen. The skin inside the ear canal may be scaly or shedding. Touching or moving the outer ear will increase the pain. The eardrum may be hard to see because of a swelling in the outer ear. The eardrum may have a hole in it. This is called a perforation. A sample of fluid may be removed from the ear and sent to a lab to look for bacteria or fungus. In most cases, you will need to use ear antibiotic drops for 10 to 14 days. If the ear canal is very swollen, a wick may be put into the ear. The wick will allow the drops to travel to the end of the canal. Your provider can show you how to do this. Other treatments may include: - Antibiotics taken by mouth if you have a middle ear infection or infection that spreads beyond the ear - Corticosteroids to reduce itching and inflammation - Pain medicine, such as acetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) - Vinegar (acetic acid) ear drops People with chronic swimmer's ear may need long-term or repeated treatment. This will to avoid complications. Placing something warm against the ear may reduce pain. Swimmer's ear most often gets better with the proper treatment. The infection may spread to other areas around the ear, including the skull bone. In older people or those who have diabetes, the infection may become severe. This condition is called malignant otitis externa. This condition is treated with high-dose antibiotics given through a vein. Call your provider if: - You develop any symptoms of swimmer's ear - You notice any drainage coming from your ears - Your symptoms get worse or continue despite treatment - You have new symptoms, such as fever or pain and redness of the skull behind the ear These steps can help protect your ears from further damage: - DO NOT scratch the ears or insert cotton swabs or other objects in the ears. - Keep ears clean and dry, and DO NOT let water enter the ears when showering, shampooing, or bathing. - Dry your ear very well after it has gotten wet. - Avoid swimming in polluted water. - Use earplugs when swimming. - Try mixing 1 drop of alcohol with 1 drop of white vinegar and placing the mixture into the ears after they get wet. The alcohol and acid in the vinegar help prevent bacterial growth. Updated by: Neil K.

ODD. Would like to learn more about condition on ODD,"Klinefelter Syndrome (KS) (What are the treatments?): It's important to remember that because symptoms can be mild, many males with KS are never diagnosed ore treated. The earlier in life that KS symptoms are recognized and treated, the more likely it is that the symptoms can be reduced or eliminated. It is especially helpful to begin treatment by early puberty. Puberty is a time of rapid physical and psychological change, and treatment can successfully limit symptoms. However, treatment can bring benefits at any age. The type of treatment needed depends on the type of symptoms being treated. Treating Physical Symptoms Treating Language and Learning Symptoms Treating Social and Behavioral Symptoms Treating Physical Symptoms Treatment for Low Testosterone About one-half of XXY males' chromosomes have low testosterone levels. These levels can be raised by taking supplemental testosterone. Testosterone treatment can: - Improve muscle mass - Deepen the voice - Promote growth of facial and body hair - Help the reproductive organs to mature - Build and maintain bone strength and help prevent osteoporosis in later years - Produce a more masculine appearance, which can also help relieve anxiety and depression - Increase focus and attention There are various ways to take testosterone: - Injections or shots, every 2 to 3 weeks - Pills - Through the skin, also called transdermal (pronounced tranz-DERM-ul); current methods include wearing a testosterone patch or rubbing testosterone gel on the skin Males taking testosterone treatment should work closely with an endocrinologist (pronounced en-doe-kren-AWL-oh-jist), a doctor who specializes in hormones and their functions, to ensure the best outcome from testosterone therapy. For information on how to find an endocrinologist, see the Resources and Publications section. Is testosterone therapy right for every XXY male? Not all males with XXY condition benefit from testosterone therapy. For males whose testosterone level is low to normal, the benefits of taking testosterone are less clear than for when testosterone is very low. Side effects, although generally mild, can include acne, skin rashes from patches or gels, breathing problems (especially during sleep), and higher risk of an enlarged prostate gland or prostate cancer in older age. In addition, testosterone supplementation will not increase testicular size, decrease breast growth, or correct infertility. Although the majority of boys with KS grow up to live as males, some develop atypical gender identities. For these males, supplemental testosterone may not be suitable. Gender identity should be discussed with health care specialists before starting treatment. Treatment for Enlarged Breasts No approved drug treatment exists for this condition of over-developed breast tissue, termed gynecomastia. Some health care providers recommend surgery—called mastectomy (pronounced ma-STEK-tuh-mee)—to remove or reduce the breasts of XXY males. When adult men have breasts, they are at higher risk for breast cancer than other men and need to be checked for this condition regularly. The mastectomy lowers the risk of cancer and can reduce the social stress associated with XXY males having enlarged breasts. Because it is a surgical procedure, mastectomy carries a variety of risks. XXY males who are thinking about mastectomy should discuss all the risks and benefits with their health care provider. Treatment for Infertility Between 95% and 99% of XXY men are infertile because they do not produce enough sperm to fertilize an egg naturally. But, sperm are found in more than 50% of men with KS. Advances in assistive reproductive technology (ART) have made it possible for some men with KS to conceive. One type of ART, called testicular sperm extraction with intracytoplasmic (pronounced in-trah-sigh-toe-PLAZ-mick) sperm injection (TESE-ICSI), has shown success for XXY males. For this procedure, a surgeon removes sperm from the testes and places one sperm into an egg. Like all ART, TESE-ICSI carries both risks and benefits. For instance, it is possible that the resulting child might have the XXY condition. In addition, the procedure is expensive and is often is not covered by health insurance plans. Importantly, there is no guarantee the procedure will work. Recent studies suggest that collecting sperm from adolescent XXY males and freezing the sperm until later might result in more pregnancies during subsequent fertility treatments. This is because although XXY males may make some healthy sperm during puberty, this becomes more difficult as they leave adolescence and enter adulthood. [top] Treating Language and Learning Symptoms Some, but not all, children with KS have language development and learning delays. They might be slow to learn to talk, read, and write, and they might have difficulty processing what they hear. But various interventions, such as speech therapy and educational assistance, can help to reduce and even eliminate these difficulties. The earlier treatment begins, the better the outcomes. Parents might need to bring these types of problems to the teacher's attention. Because these boys can be quiet and cooperative in the classroom, teachers may not notice the need for help. Boys and men with KS can benefit by visiting therapists who are experts in areas such as coordination, social skills, and coping. XXY males might benefit from any or all of the following: - Physical therapists design activities and exercises to build motor skills and strength and to improve muscle control, posture, and balance. - Occupational therapists help build skills needed for daily functioning, such as social and play skills, interaction and conversation skills, and job or career skills that match interests and abilities. - Behavioral therapists help with specific social skills, such as asking other kids to play and starting conversations. They can also teach productive ways of handling frustration, shyness, anger, and other emotions that can arise from feeling ""different."" - Mental health therapists or counselors help males with KS find ways to cope with feelings of sadness, depression, self-doubt, and low self-esteem. They can also help with substance abuse problems. These professionals can also help families deal with the emotions of having a son with KS. - Family therapists provide counseling to a man with KS, his spouse, partner, or family. They can help identify relationship problems and help patients develop communication skills and understand other people's needs. Parents of XXY males have also mentioned that taking part in physical activities at low-key levels, such as karate, swimming, tennis, and golf, were helpful in improving motor skills, coordination, and confidence. With regard to education, some boys with KS will qualify to receive state-sponsored special needs services to address their developmental and learning symptoms. But, because these symptoms may be mild, many XXY males will not be eligible for these services. Families can contact a local school district official or special education coordinator to learn more about whether XXY males can receive the following free services: - The Early Intervention Program for Infants and Toddlers with Disabilities is required by two national laws, the Individuals with Disabilities and Education Improvement Act (IDEIA) and the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). Every state operates special programs for children from birth to age 3, helping them develop in areas such as behavior, development, communication, and social play. - An Individualized Education Plan (IEP) for school is created and administered by a team of people, starting with parents and including teachers and school psychologists. The team works together to design an IEP with specific academic, communication, motor, learning, functional, and socialization goals, based on the child's educational needs and specific symptoms. [top] Treating Social and Behavioral Symptoms Many of the professionals and methods for treating learning and language symptoms of the XXY condition are similar to or the same as the ones used to address social and behavioral symptoms. For instance, boys with KS may need help with social skills and interacting in groups. Occupational or behavioral therapists might be able to assist with these skills. Some school districts and health centers might also offer these types of skill-building programs or classes. In adolescence, symptoms such as lack of body hair could make XXY males uncomfortable in school or other social settings, and this discomfort can lead to depression, substance abuse, and behavioral problems or ""acting out."" They might also have questions about their masculinity or gender identity. In these instances, consulting a psychologist, counselor, or psychiatrist may be helpful. Contrary to research results released decades ago, current research shows that XXY males are no more likely than other males to have serious psychiatric disorders or to get into trouble with the law.

ODD. Would like to learn more about condition on ODD,"Klinefelter Syndrome (KS): ​​​KS describes a set of physical, language, and social development symptoms in males who have an extra X chromosome. Its main feature is infertility. Outward signs of KS can be subtle, so symptoms often are not recognized, and may not be treated in a timely manner. The NICHD is one of many federal agencies and NIH Institutes working to understand KS, discover why it occurs, and identify and treat its symptoms. ​​​ ​ ​ What is KS? The term ""Klinefelter (pronounced KLAHYN-fel-ter) syndrome,"" or KS, describes a set of features that can occur in a male who is born with an extra X chromosome (pronounced KROH-muh-sohm) in his cells. It is named after Dr. Henry Klinefelter, who identified the condition in the 1940s. Usually, every cell in a male's body, except sperm and red blood cells, contains 46 chromosomes. The 45th and 46th chromosomes—the X and Y chromosomes—are sometimes called ""sex chromosomes"" because they determine a person's sex. Normally, males have one X and one Y chromosome, making them XY. Males with KS have an extra X chromosome, making them XXY. KS is sometimes called ""47,XXY"" (47 refers to total chromosomes) or the ""XXY condition."" Those with KS are sometimes called ""XXY males."" Some males with KS may have both XY cells and XXY cells in their bodies. This is called ""mosaic"" (mo-ZAY-ik). Mosaic males may have fewer symptoms of KS depending on the number of XY cells they have in their bodies and where these cells are located. For example, males who have normal XY cells in their testes may be fertile. In very rare cases, males might have two or more extra X chromosomes in their cells, for instance XXXY or XXXXY, or an extra Y, such as XXYY. This is called poly-X Klinefelter syndrome, and it causes more severe symptoms. What causes it? » The extra chromosome results from a random error that occurs when a sperm or egg is formed; this error causes an extra X cell to be included each time the cell divides to form new cells. In very rare cases, more than one extra X or an extra Y is included. « Condition Information How many people are affected/at risk? » Researchers estimate that 1 male in about 500 newborn males has an extra X chromosome, making KS among the most common chromosomal disorders seen in all newborns.The likelihood of a third or fourth X is much rarer: Prevalence of Klinefelter syndrome variants Number of extra X chromosomes One (XXY) Two (XXXY) Three (XXXXY) Number of newborn males with the condition 1 in 500 1 in 50,000 1 in 85,000 to 100,000 Scientists are not sure what factors increase the risk of KS. The error that produces the extra chromosome occurs at random, meaning the error is not hereditary (pronounced huh-RED-i-ter-ee) or passed down from parent to child. Research suggests that older mothers might be slightly more likely to have a son with KS. However, the extra X chromosome in KS comes from the father about one-half of the time. - Nielsen, J., and Wohlert, M. (1991).

What are common symptoms? » Because XXY males do not really appear different from other males and because they may not have any or have mild symptoms, XXY males often don't know they have KS. In other cases, males with KS may have mild or severe symptoms. Whether or not a male with KS has visible symptoms depends on many factors, including how much testosterone his body makes, if he is mosaic (with both XY and XXY cells), and his age when the condition is diagnosed and treated. KS symptoms fall into these main categories: - Physical Symptoms - Language and Learning Symptoms - Social and Behavioral Symptoms - Symptoms of Poly-X KS Physical Symptoms Many physical symptoms of KS result from low testosterone levels in the body. The degree of symptoms differs based on the amount of testosterone needed for a specific age or developmental stage and the amount of testosterone the body makes or has available. During the first few years of life, when the need for testosterone is low, most XXY males do not show any obvious differences from typical male infants and young boys. Some may have slightly weaker muscles, meaning they might sit up, crawl, and walk slightly later than average. For example, on average, baby boys with KS do not start walking until age 18 months. After age 5 years, when compared to typically developing boys, boys with KS may be slightly: - Taller - Fatter around the belly - Clumsier - Slower in developing motor skills, coordination, speed, and muscle strength Puberty for boys with KS usually starts normally. But because their bodies make less testosterone than non-KS boys, their pubertal development may be disrupted or slow. In addition to being tall, KS boys may have: - Smaller testes and penis - Breast growth (about one-third of teens with KS have breast growth) - Less facial and body hair - Reduced muscle tone - Narrower shoulders and wider hips - Weaker bones, greater risk for bone fractures - Decreased sexual interest - Lower energy - Reduced sperm production An adult male with KS may have these features: - Infertility: Nearly all men with KS are unable to father a biologically-related child without help from a fertility specialist. - Small testes, with the possibility of testes shrinking slightly after the teen years - Lower testosterone levels, which lead to less muscle, hair, and sexual interest and function - Breasts or breast growth (called gynecomastia, pronounced GUY-nuh-kow-mast-ee-uh). In some cases, breast growth can be permanent, and about 10% of XXY males need breast-reduction surgery. [top] Language and Learning Symptoms Most males with KS have normal intelligence quotients (IQs) and successfully complete education at all levels. (IQ is a frequently used intelligence measure, but does not include emotional, creative, or other types of intelligence.) Between 25% and 85% of all males with KS have some kind of learning or language-related problem, which makes it more likely that they will need some extra help in school. Without this help or intervention, KS males might fall behind their classmates as schoolwork becomes harder. KS males may experience some of the following learning and language-related challenges: - A delay in learning to talk. Infants with KS tend to make only a few different vocal sounds. As they grow older, they may have difficulty saying words clearly. It might be hard for them to distinguish differences between similar sounds. - Trouble using language to express their thoughts and needs. Boys with KS might have problems putting their thoughts, ideas, and emotions into words. Some may find it hard to learn and remember some words, such as the names of common objects. - Trouble processing what they hear. Although most boys with KS can understand what is being said to them, they might take longer to process multiple or complex sentences. In some cases, they might fidget or ""tune out"" because they take longer to process the information. It might also be difficult for KS males to concentrate in noisy settings. They might also be less able to understand a speaker's feelings from just speech alone. - Reading difficulties. Many boys with KS have difficulty understanding what they read (called poor reading comprehension). They might also read more slowly than other boys. By adulthood, most males with KS learn to speak and converse normally, although they may have a harder time doing work that involves extensive reading and writing. [top] Social and Behavioral Symptoms Many of the social and behavioral symptoms in KS may result from the language and learning difficulties. For instance, boys with KS who have language difficulties might hold back socially and could use help building social relationships. Boys with KS, compared to typically developing boys, tend to be: - Quieter - Less assertive or self-confident - More anxious or restless - Less physically active - More helpful and eager to please - More obedient or more ready to follow directions In the teenage years, boys with KS may feel their differences more strongly. As a result, these teen boys are at higher risk of depression, substance abuse, and behavioral disorders. Some teens might withdraw, feel sad, or act out their frustration and anger. As adults, most men with KS have lives similar to those of men without KS. They successfully complete high school, college, and other levels of education. They have successful and meaningful careers and professions. They have friends and families. Contrary to research findings published several decades ago, males with KS are no more likely to have serious psychiatric disorders or to get into trouble with the law. [top] Symptoms of Poly-X KS Males with poly-X Klinefelter syndrome have more than one extra X chromosome, so their symptoms might be more pronounced than in males with KS. In childhood, they may also have seizures, crossed eyes, constipation, and recurrent ear infections. Poly-KS males might also show slight differences in other physical features. Some common additional symptoms for several poly-X Klinefelter syndromes are listed below. 48,XXYY - Long legs - Little body hair - Lower IQ, average of 60 to 80 (normal IQ is 90 to 110) - Leg ulcers and other vascular disease symptoms - Extreme shyness, but also sometimes aggression and impulsiveness 48,XXXY (or tetrasomy) - Eyes set further apart - Flat nose bridge - Arm bones connected to each other in an unusual way - Short - Fifth (smallest) fingers curve inward (clinodactyly, pronounced KLAHY-noh-dak-tl-ee) - Lower IQ, average 40 to 60 - Immature behavior 49,XXXXY (or pentasomy) - Low IQ, usually between 20 and 60 - Small head - Short - Upward-slanted eyes - Heart defects, such as when the chambers do not form properly - High feet arches - Shy, but friendly - Difficulty with changing routines [top] « How many people are affected/at risk? What are the treatments? » It's important to remember that because symptoms can be mild, many males with KS are never diagnosed ore treated. The earlier in life that KS symptoms are recognized and treated, the more likely it is that the symptoms can be reduced or eliminated. It is especially helpful to begin treatment by early puberty. Puberty is a time of rapid physical and psychological change, and treatment can successfully limit symptoms. However, treatment can bring benefits at any age. The type of treatment needed depends on the type of symptoms being treated. Treating Physical Symptoms Treating Language and Learning Symptoms Treating Social and Behavioral Symptoms Treating Physical Symptoms Treatment for Low Testosterone About one-half of XXY males' chromosomes have low testosterone levels. These levels can be raised by taking supplemental testosterone. Testosterone treatment can: - Improve muscle mass - Deepen the voice - Promote growth of facial and body hair - Help the reproductive organs to mature - Build and maintain bone strength and help prevent osteoporosis in later years - Produce a more masculine appearance, which can also help relieve anxiety and depression - Increase focus and attention There are various ways to take testosterone: - Injections or shots, every 2 to 3 weeks - Pills - Through the skin, also called transdermal (pronounced tranz-DERM-ul); current methods include wearing a testosterone patch or rubbing testosterone gel on the skin Males taking testosterone treatment should work closely with an endocrinologist (pronounced en-doe-kren-AWL-oh-jist), a doctor who specializes in hormones and their functions, to ensure the best outcome from testosterone therapy. For information on how to find an endocrinologist, see the Resources and Publications section. Is testosterone therapy right for every XXY male? Not all males with XXY condition benefit from testosterone therapy. For males whose testosterone level is low to normal, the benefits of taking testosterone are less clear than for when testosterone is very low. Side effects, although generally mild, can include acne, skin rashes from patches or gels, breathing problems (especially during sleep), and higher risk of an enlarged prostate gland or prostate cancer in older age. In addition, testosterone supplementation will not increase testicular size, decrease breast growth, or correct infertility. Although the majority of boys with KS grow up to live as males, some develop atypical gender identities. For these males, supplemental testosterone may not be suitable. Gender identity should be discussed with health care specialists before starting treatment. Treatment for Enlarged Breasts No approved drug treatment exists for this condition of over-developed breast tissue, termed gynecomastia. Some health care providers recommend surgery—called mastectomy (pronounced ma-STEK-tuh-mee)—to remove or reduce the breasts of XXY males. When adult men have breasts, they are at higher risk for breast cancer than other men and need to be checked for this condition regularly. The mastectomy lowers the risk of cancer and can reduce the social stress associated with XXY males having enlarged breasts. Because it is a surgical procedure, mastectomy carries a variety of risks. XXY males who are thinking about mastectomy should discuss all the risks and benefits with their health care provider. Treatment for Infertility Between 95% and 99% of XXY men are infertile because they do not produce enough sperm to fertilize an egg naturally. But, sperm are found in more than 50% of men with KS. Advances in assistive reproductive technology (ART) have made it possible for some men with KS to conceive. One type of ART, called testicular sperm extraction with intracytoplasmic (pronounced in-trah-sigh-toe-PLAZ-mick) sperm injection (TESE-ICSI), has shown success for XXY males. For this procedure, a surgeon removes sperm from the testes and places one sperm into an egg. Like all ART, TESE-ICSI carries both risks and benefits. For instance, it is possible that the resulting child might have the XXY condition. In addition, the procedure is expensive and is often is not covered by health insurance plans. Importantly, there is no guarantee the procedure will work. Recent studies suggest that collecting sperm from adolescent XXY males and freezing the sperm until later might result in more pregnancies during subsequent fertility treatments. This is because although XXY males may make some healthy sperm during puberty, this becomes more difficult as they leave adolescence and enter adulthood. [top] Treating Language and Learning Symptoms Some, but not all, children with KS have language development and learning delays. They might be slow to learn to talk, read, and write, and they might have difficulty processing what they hear. But various interventions, such as speech therapy and educational assistance, can help to reduce and even eliminate these difficulties. The earlier treatment begins, the better the outcomes. Parents might need to bring these types of problems to the teacher's attention. Because these boys can be quiet and cooperative in the classroom, teachers may not notice the need for help. Boys and men with KS can benefit by visiting therapists who are experts in areas such as coordination, social skills, and coping. XXY males might benefit from any or all of the following: - Physical therapists design activities and exercises to build motor skills and strength and to improve muscle control, posture, and balance. - Occupational therapists help build skills needed for daily functioning, such as social and play skills, interaction and conversation skills, and job or career skills that match interests and abilities. - Behavioral therapists help with specific social skills, such as asking other kids to play and starting conversations. They can also teach productive ways of handling frustration, shyness, anger, and other emotions that can arise from feeling ""different."" - Mental health therapists or counselors help males with KS find ways to cope with feelings of sadness, depression, self-doubt, and low self-esteem. They can also help with substance abuse problems. These professionals can also help families deal with the emotions of having a son with KS. - Family therapists provide counseling to a man with KS, his spouse, partner, or family. They can help identify relationship problems and help patients develop communication skills and understand other people's needs. Parents of XXY males have also mentioned that taking part in physical activities at low-key levels, such as karate, swimming, tennis, and golf, were helpful in improving motor skills, coordination, and confidence. With regard to education, some boys with KS will qualify to receive state-sponsored special needs services to address their developmental and learning symptoms. But, because these symptoms may be mild, many XXY males will not be eligible for these services. Families can contact a local school district official or special education coordinator to learn more about whether XXY males can receive the following free services: - The Early Intervention Program for Infants and Toddlers with Disabilities is required by two national laws, the Individuals with Disabilities and Education Improvement Act (IDEIA) and the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). Every state operates special programs for children from birth to age 3, helping them develop in areas such as behavior, development, communication, and social play. - An Individualized Education Plan (IEP) for school is created and administered by a team of people, starting with parents and including teachers and school psychologists. The team works together to design an IEP with specific academic, communication, motor, learning, functional, and socialization goals, based on the child's educational needs and specific symptoms. [top] Treating Social and Behavioral Symptoms Many of the professionals and methods for treating learning and language symptoms of the XXY condition are similar to or the same as the ones used to address social and behavioral symptoms. For instance, boys with KS may need help with social skills and interacting in groups. Occupational or behavioral therapists might be able to assist with these skills. Some school districts and health centers might also offer these types of skill-building programs or classes. In adolescence, symptoms such as lack of body hair could make XXY males uncomfortable in school or other social settings, and this discomfort can lead to depression, substance abuse, and behavioral problems or ""acting out."" They might also have questions about their masculinity or gender identity. In these instances, consulting a psychologist, counselor, or psychiatrist may be helpful. Contrary to research results released decades ago, current research shows that XXY males are no more likely than other males to have serious psychiatric disorders or to get into trouble with the law. [top] « What are common symptoms? How is it diagnosed? » ​​ The only way to confirm the presence of an extra chromosome is by a karyotype (pronounced care-EE-oh-type) test. A health care provider will take a small blood or skin sample and send it to a laboratory, where a technician inspects the cells under a microscope to find the extra chromosome. A karyotype test shows the same results at any time in a person's life. Tests for chromosome disorders, including KS, may be done before birth. To obtain tissue or liquid for this test, a pregnant woman undergoes chorionic villus (pronounced KAWR-ee-on-ik vil-uhs) sampling or amniocentesis (am-nee-oh-sen-TEE-sis). These types of prenatal testing carry a small risk for miscarriage and are not routinely conducted unless the woman has a family history of chromosomal disorders, has other medical problems, or is above 35 years of age. Factors that Influence when KS is Diagnosed Because symptoms can be mild, some males with KS are never diagnosed. Several factors affect whether and when a diagnosis occurs: - Few newborns and boys are tested for or diagnosed with KS. - Although newborns in the United States are screened for some conditions, they are not screened for XXY or other sex-chromosome differences. - In childhood, symptoms can be subtle and overlooked easily. Only about 1 in 10 males with KS is diagnosed before puberty. - Sometimes, visiting a health care provider will not produce a diagnosis. Some symptoms, such as delayed early speech, might be treated successfully without further testing for KS. - Most XXY diagnoses occur at puberty or in adulthood. - Puberty brings a surge in diagnoses as some males (or their parents) become concerned about slow testes growth or breast development and consult a health care provider. - Many men are diagnosed for the first time in fertility clinics. Among men seeking help for infertility, about 15% have KS; « What are the treatments? Is there a cure? » Currently, there is no way to remove chromosomes from cells to ""cure"" the XXY condition. But many symptoms can be successfully treated, minimizing the impact the condition has on length and quality of life. Most adult XXY men have full independence and have friends, families, and normal social relationships. They live about as long as other men, on average. « How is it diagnosed? Other FAQs » Are there disorders or conditions associated with KS? Can KS lead to cancer? If I have KS, will I be able to get a woman pregnant? If my son, family member, partner, or spouse is diagnosed with XXY condition, how can I help him and the family? What is the best way to teach or communicate with males who have KS? Are there disorders or conditions associated with KS? Males with KS are at higher risk for some other health conditions, for reasons that are not fully understood. But these risks can be minimized by paying attention to symptoms and treating them appropriately. Associated conditions include: - Autoimmune disorders, such as type 1 diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, hypothyroidism, and lupus. In these disorders, the immune cells attack parts of the body instead of protecting them. - Breast cancer. Males with KS have a higher risk of developing this cancer, although still a lower risk than females'. XXY males should pay attention to any changes in their breasts, such as lumps or any leakage from the nipple, and should see their health care provider right away if they have any concerns. - Venous (pronounced VEE-nuss) disease, or diseases of the arteries and veins. Some of these include: - Varicose veins - Deep vein thrombosis (pronounced thrahm-BOW-siss), a blood clot in a deep vein - Pulmonary embolism (pronounced PUHL-muh-ner-ee EM-buh-liz-uhm), a blockage of an artery in the lungs - To reduce their risk, males can keep a normal body weight; get regular, moderate physical activity; quit smoking; and avoid sitting or standing in the same position for long periods of time. If venous diseases develop, they can be treated in different ways, depending on their severity. For instance, some treatments include wearing compression socks and others require taking blood thinner medications. - Tooth decay. Almost one-half of men with KS have taurodontism (pronounced tawr-oh-DAWNT-iz-uhm), a dental problem in which the teeth have larger-than-normal chambers for holding pulp (the soft tissue that contains nerve endings and blood vessels) and shorter-than-normal tooth roots, both of which make it easier for tooth decay to develop. Regular dental check-ups and good oral hygiene habits will help prevent, catch, and treat problems. - Osteoporosis (pronounced os-tee-oh-puh-ROH-sis), in which bones lose calcium, become brittle, and break more easily, may develop over time in KS males who have low testosterone levels for long periods of time. Testosterone treatment; regular, moderate physical activity; and eating a healthy diet can decrease the risk of osteoporosis. If the disease develops, medications can help limit its severity. [top] Can KS lead to cancer? Compared with the general male population, men with KS may have a higher chance over time of getting breast cancer, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and lung cancer. There are ways to reduce this risk, such as removing the breasts and avoiding use of tobacco products. In general, XXY males are also at lower risk for prostate cancer. [top] If I have KS, will I be able to get a woman pregnant? It is possible that an XXY male could get a woman pregnant naturally. Although sperm are found in more than 50% of men with KS, low sperm production could make conception very difficult. A few men with KS have recently been able to father a biologically related child by undergoing assisted fertility services, specifically, a procedure called  testicular sperm extraction with intracytoplasmic sperm injection (TESE-ICSI). TESE-ICSI, this carries a slightly higher risk of chromosomal disorders in the child, including having an extra X. [top] If my son, family member, partner, or spouse is diagnosed with XXY condition, how can I help him and the family? If someone you know is diagnosed with KS: - Recognize your feelings. It is natural for parents or family members to feel that they have done something to cause KS. But, remember it is a genetic disorder that occurs at random—there is nothing you could have done or not done to prevent it from happening. Allow yourself and your family time to deal with your feelings. Talk with your health care provider about your concerns. - Educate yourself about the disorder. It is common to fear the unknown. Educate yourself about the XXY condition and its symptoms so you know how you can help your son, family member, or partner/spouse. - Support your son, family member, or partner/spouse. Provide appropriate education about KS and give him the emotional support and encouragement he needs. Remember, most XXY males go through life with few problems, and many never find out they have the condition. - Be actively involved in your son's, family member's, or partner's/spouse's care. Talk with your health care provider and his health care provider about his treatment. If counseling for behavioral problems is needed, or if special learning environments or methods are needed, get help from qualified professionals who have experience working with XXY males. - Encourage your son, family member, partner/spouse to do activities to improve his physical motor skills, such as karate or swimming. - Work with your teachers/educators and supervisors/co-workers. - Contact these people regularly to compare how he is doing at home and at school/work. - When appropriate, encourage him to talk with his teachers, educators, supervisor, and co-workers. Suggest using brief notes, telephone calls, and meetings to identify problems and propose solutions. - Encourage your son's, family member's, partner's/spouse's independence. Although it is important to be supportive, realize that watching over too much can send the message that you think he is not able to do things on his own. - Share the following information with health care providers about XXY problems: XXY males may have Consider recommending Delayed early expressive language and speech milestones Early speech therapy and language evaluation Difficulty during transition from elementary school to middle school or high school Re-testing to identify learning areas that require extra attention at or before entrance to middle/high school Difficulty with math at all ages Testing to identify problem areas and remediation for math disabilities Difficulty with complex language processing, specifically with understanding and creating spoken language Language evaluation, increased opportunities to communicate through written language, possibly getting written notes from lectures/discussions Decreased running speed, agility, and overall strength in childhood Physical therapy, occupational therapy, activities that build strength [top] What is the best way to teach or communicate with males who have KS? Research has identified some ways in which educators and parents can improve learning and communication among XXY males, including: - Using images and visual clues - Teaching them new words - Encouraging conversation - Using examples in language - Minimizing distractions - Breaking tasks into small steps - Creating opportunities for social interaction and understanding - Reminding them to stay focused [top] - Michael, J.

"about uveitis. IS THE UVEITIS, AN AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE?","Uveitis: Uveitis is swelling and irritation of the uvea. The uvea is the middle layer of the eye. The uvea provides most of the blood supply to the retina. Uveitis can be caused by autoimmune disorders. These diseases occur when the body's immune system attacks and destroys healthy body tissue by mistake. Examples are: - Ankylosing spondylitis - Psoriasis - Reactive arthritis - Rheumatoid arthritis - Sarcoidosis - Ulcerative colitis Uveitis can also be caused by infections such as: - AIDS - Cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis - Herpes zoster infection - Histoplasmosis - Kawasaki disease - Syphilis - Toxoplasmosis - Tuberculosis Exposure to toxins or injury can also cause uveitis. In many cases, the cause is unknown. The most common form of uveitis involves inflammation the front part of the eye. It is often called iritis because it most often only affects the iris. The iris is the colored part of the eye. In most cases, it occurs in healthy people. The disorder may affect only one eye. It is most common in young and middle-aged people. Posterior uveitis affects the back part of the eye. It involves primarily the choroid. This is the layer of blood vessels and connective tissue in the middle layer of the eye. This type of uveitis is called choroiditis. If the retina is also involved, it is called chorioretinitis. Another form of uveitis is pars planitis. Changes involve the narrowed area (pars plana) between the colored part of the eye (iris) and the choroid. Pars planitis most often occurs in young men. It is generally not associated with any other disease. However, it may be linked to Crohn disease and possibly multiple sclerosis. Uveitis can affect one or both eyes. Symptoms may develop rapidly and can include: - Blurred vision - Dark, floating spots in the vision - Eye pain - Redness of the eye - Sensitivity to light The health care provider will take a complete medical history and do an eye exam. Lab tests may be done to rule out infection or a weak immune system. If you are over age 25 and have pars planitis, your provider will suggest a brain and spine MRI. This will rule out multiple sclerosis. Iritis (anterior uveitis) is most often mild. Treatment may involve: - Dark glasses - Eye drops that dilate the pupil to relieve pain - Steroid eye drops Pars planitis is often treated with steroid eye drops. Other medicines, including steroids taken by mouth, may be used to help suppress the immune system. Posterior uveitis treatment depends on the underlying cause. It almost always includes steroids taken by mouth. If the uveitis is caused by a body-wide (systemic) infection, you may be given antibiotics. You may also be given powerful anti-inflammatory medicines called corticosteroids. With proper treatment, most attacks of anterior uveitis go away in a few days to weeks. However, the problem often returns. Posterior uveitis may last from months to years. It may cause permanent vision damage, even with treatment. Complications may include: - Cataracts - Fluid within the retina - Glaucoma - Irregular pupil - Retinal detachment - Vision loss Symptoms that need urgent medical care are: - Eye pain - Reduced vision If you have a body-wide (systemic) infection or disease, treating the condition will prevent uveitis.

To use the lotion, cream, or gel, first wash the affected skin areas and gently pat dry with a towel. Then apply a small amount of benzoyl Peroxide, rub it in gently. Avoid anything that may irritate your skin (e.g., abrasive soaps or cleansers, alcohol-containing products, cosmetics or soaps that dry the skin, medicated cosmetics, sunlight, and sunlamps) unless directed otherwise by your doctor. It may take 4 to 6 weeks to see the effects of this medication. If your acne does not improve after this time, call your doctor. Do not allow medication to get into your eyes, mouth, and nose. Do not use benzoyl peroxide on children less than 12 years of age without talking to a doctor. Before using benzoyl peroxide, - tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to benzoyl peroxide, any other medications, or any of the ingredients in benzoyl peroxide products. Ask your pharmacist or check the package label for a list of the ingredients. - tell your doctor and pharmacist what prescription and nonprescription medications you are taking, including vitamins. - tell your doctor if you are pregnant, plan to become pregnant, or are breastfeeding. If you become pregnant while using benzoyl peroxide, call your doctor. Apply the missed dose as soon as you remember it. However, if it is almost time for the next dose, skip the missed dose and continue your regular dosing schedule. Do not apply a double dose to make up for a missed one. Benzoyl peroxide may cause side effects. Tell your doctor if any of these symptoms are severe or do not go away: - dryness or peeling of skin - feeling of warmth - tingling - slight stinging Some side effects may be serious. If you experience any of these symptoms, call your doctor immediately or get emergency medical treatment: - burning, blistering, redness, or swelling of the area of the treated area - rash If you experience any of the following symptoms, stop using benzoyl peroxide and call your doctor immediately or get emergency medical help: - hives - itching - throat tightness - difficulty breathing - feeling faint - swelling of the eyes, face, lips, or tongue If you experience a serious side effect, you or your doctor may send a report to the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) MedWatch Adverse Event Reporting program online (http://www.fda.gov/Safety/MedWatch) or by phone (1-800-332-1088). Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them. However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.

methylprednisolole. unable to fine info on the above med,"Methylprednisolone: Methylprednisolone, a corticosteroid, is similar to a natural hormone produced by your adrenal glands. It is often used to replace this chemical when your body does not make enough of it. It relieves inflammation (swelling, heat, redness, and pain) and is used to treat certain forms of arthritis; skin, blood, kidney, eye, thyroid, and intestinal disorders (e.g., colitis); severe allergies; and asthma. Methylprednisolone is also used to treat certain types of cancer. This medication is sometimes prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information. Methylprednisolone comes as a tablet to take by mouth. Your doctor will prescribe a dosing schedule that is best for you. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take methylprednisolone exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor. Do not stop taking methylprednisolone without talking to your doctor. Stopping the drug abruptly can cause loss of appetite, upset stomach, vomiting, drowsiness, confusion, headache, fever, joint and muscle pain, peeling skin, and weight loss. If you take large doses for a long time, your doctor probably will decrease your dose gradually to allow your body to adjust before stopping the drug completely. Watch for these side effects if you are gradually decreasing your dose and after you stop taking the tablets. If these problems occur, call your doctor immediately. You may need to increase your dose of tablets temporarily or start taking them again. Before taking methylprednisolone, - tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to methylprednisolone, aspirin, tartrazine (a yellow dye in some processed foods and drugs), or any other drugs. - tell your doctor and pharmacist what prescription and nonprescription medications you are taking, especially anticoagulants ('blood thinners') such as warfarin (Coumadin), arthritis medications, aspirin, azithromycin (Zithromax), clarithromycin (Biaxin), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), digoxin (Lanoxin), diuretics ('water pills'), erythromycin, estrogen (Premarin), ketoconazole (Nizoral), oral contraceptives, phenobarbital, phenytoin (Dilantin), rifampin (Rifadin), theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamins. - if you have a fungal infection (other than on your skin), do not take methylprednisolone without talking to your doctor. - tell your doctor if you have or have ever had liver, kidney, intestinal, or heart disease; diabetes; an underactive thyroid gland; high blood pressure; mental illness; myasthenia gravis; osteoporosis; herpes eye infection; seizures; tuberculosis (TB); or ulcers. - tell your doctor if you are pregnant, plan to become pregnant, or are breast-feeding. If you become pregnant while taking methylprednisolone, call your doctor. - if you are having surgery, including dental surgery, tell the doctor or dentist that you are taking methylprednisolone. - if you have a history of ulcers or take large doses of aspirin or other arthritis medication, limit your consumption of alcoholic beverages while taking this drug. Methylprednisolone makes your stomach and intestines more susceptible to the irritating effects of alcohol, aspirin, and certain arthritis medications. This effect increases your risk of ulcers. Your doctor may instruct you to follow a low-sodium, low-salt, potassium-rich, or high-protein diet. Follow these directions. Methylprednisolone may cause an upset stomach. Take methylprednisolone with food or milk. When you start to take methylprednisolone, ask your doctor what to do if you forget a dose. Write down these instructions so that you can refer to them later. If you take methylprednisolone once a day, take the missed dose as soon as you remember it.

"Article on Exercise for Impaired - Overweight - Asthmatics. I just found the site through the article on breathing difficulty. My frustration is, WHAT exercises to do with asthma? Today I walked out of the door of the house to take a walk, a beautiful, cool, blustery, sunny day. Suddenly I couldn't catch my breath, my upper chest felt 'heavy', and I had to go back inside and sit down for a while. I'm no exercise weenie, before a couple of bad accidents (car crashes waiting at stop lights!) I used to play softball, volleyball, basketball, even a bit of rugby, I was a dancer and a weight-exerciser, a bicyclist, rollerblader, tree climber. Even today, BP is typically 110-120 over 70-80, heart rate is fine too. Is this just asthma? WHAT exercises can I do, safely? Sure, we ALL get it, exercise is good for us. Just which ones? LOTS of us with asthma would love help here. Thanks.","Asthma: Asthma is a disease that causes the airways of the lungs to swell and narrow. It leads to wheezing, shortness of breath, chest tightness, and coughing. Asthma is caused by swelling (inflammation) in the airways. When an asthma attack occurs, the lining of the air passages swells and the muscles surrounding the airways become tight. This reduces the amount of air that can pass through the airway. In people who have sensitive airways, asthma symptoms can be triggered by breathing in substances called allergens or triggers. Common asthma triggers include: - Animals (pet hair or dander) - Dust mites - Certain medicines (aspirin and other NSAIDS) - Changes in weather (most often cold weather) - Chemicals in the air or in food - Exercise - Mold - Pollen - Respiratory infections, such as the common cold - Strong emotions (stress) - Tobacco smoke Substances in some workplaces can also trigger asthma symptoms, leading to occupational asthma. The most common triggers are wood dust, grain dust, animal dander, fungi, or chemicals. Many people with asthma have a personal or family history of allergies, such as hay fever (allergic rhinitis) or eczema. Others have no history of allergies. Most people with asthma have attacks separated by symptom-free periods. Some people have long-term shortness of breath with episodes of increased shortness of breath. Either wheezing or a cough may be the main symptom. Asthma attacks can last for minutes to days. Attacks can become dangerous if airflow is severely blocked. Symptoms of asthma include: - Cough with or without sputum (phlegm) production - Pulling in of the skin between the ribs when breathing (intercostal retractions) - Shortness of breath that gets worse with exercise or activity - Wheezing Emergency symptoms that need prompt medical help include: - Bluish color to the lips and face - Decreased level of alertness, such as severe drowsiness or confusion, during an asthma attack - Extreme difficulty breathing - Rapid pulse - Severe anxiety due to shortness of breath - Sweating Other symptoms that may occur: - Abnormal breathing pattern -- breathing out takes more than twice as long as breathing in - Breathing temporarily stops - Chest pain - Tightness in the chest The health care provider will use a stethoscope to listen to your lungs. Wheezing or other asthma-related sounds may be heard. Tests that may be ordered include: - Allergy testing -- skin or a blood test to see if a person with asthma is allergic to certain substances - Arterial blood gas (usually only done with people who are having a severe asthma attack) - Chest x-ray - Lung function tests, including peak flow measurements The goals of treatment are: - Control airway swelling - Stay away from substances that trigger your symptoms - Help you to be able to do normal activities without asthma symptoms You and your doctor should work as a team to manage your asthma. Follow your doctor's instructions on taking medicines, eliminating asthma triggers, and monitoring symptoms. MEDICINES FOR ASTHMA There are two kinds of medicines for treating asthma: - Control medicines to help prevent attacks - Quick-relief (rescue) medicines for use during attacks LONG-TERM MEDICINES These are also called maintenance or control medicines. They are used to prevent symptoms in people with moderate to severe asthma. You must take them every day for them to work. Take them even when you feel OK. Some long-term medicines are breathed in (inhaled), such as steroids and long-acting beta-agonists. Others are taken by mouth (orally). Your doctor will prescribe the right medicine for you. QUICK-RELIEF MEDICINES These are also called rescue medicines. They are taken: - For coughing, wheezing, trouble breathing, or an asthma attack - Just before exercising to help prevent asthma symptoms caused by exercise Tell your doctor if you are using quick-relief medicines twice a week or more. If so, your asthma may not be under control and your doctor may need to change your dose of daily control drugs. Quick-relief medicines include: - Short-acting inhaled bronchodilators - Oral corticosteroids for when you have an asthma attack that is not going away A severe asthma attack requires a checkup by a doctor. You may also need a hospital stay. There, you will likely be given oxygen, breathing assistance, and medicines given through a vein (IV). ASTHMA CARE AT HOME - Know the asthma symptoms to watch for. - Know how to take your peak flow reading and what it means. - Know which triggers make your asthma worse and what to do when this happens. - Know how to care for your asthma when you exercise. Asthma action plans are written documents for managing asthma. An asthma action plan should include: - Instructions for taking asthma medicines when your condition is stable - A list of asthma triggers and how to avoid them - How to recognize when your asthma is getting worse, and when to call your provider A peak flow meter is a simple device to measure how quickly you can move air out of your lungs. - It can help you see if an attack is coming, sometimes even before symptoms appear. Peak flow measurements help let you know when you need to take medicine or other action. - Peak flow values of 50% to 80% of your best results are a sign of a moderate asthma attack. Numbers below 50% are a sign of a severe attack. There is no cure for asthma, although symptoms sometimes improve over time. With proper self-management and medical treatment, most people with asthma can lead a normal life. The complications of asthma can be severe, and may include: - Death - Decreased ability to exercise and take part in other activities - Lack of sleep due to nighttime symptoms - Permanent changes in the function of the lungs - Persistent cough - Trouble breathing that requires breathing assistance (ventilator) Call for an appointment with your provider if asthma symptoms develop. Call your provider or go to the emergency room if: - An asthma attack requires more medicine than recommended - Symptoms get worse or do not improve with treatment - You have shortness of breath while talking - Your peak flow measurement is 50% to 80% of your personal best Go to the emergency room if these symptoms occur: - Drowsiness or confusion - Severe shortness of breath at rest - A peak flow measurement of less than 50% of your personal best - Severe chest pain - Bluish color to the lips and face - Extreme difficulty breathing - Rapid pulse - Severe anxiety due to shortness of breath You can reduce asthma symptoms by avoiding triggers and substances that irritate the airways. - Cover bedding with allergy-proof casings to reduce exposure to dust mites. - Remove carpets from bedrooms and vacuum regularly. - Use only unscented detergents and cleaning materials in the home. - Keep humidity levels low and fix leaks to reduce the growth of organisms such as mold. - Keep the house clean and keep food in containers and out of bedrooms. This helps reduce the possibility of cockroaches. Body parts and droppings from cockroaches can trigger asthma attacks in some people. - If someone is allergic to an animal that cannot be removed from the home, the animal should be kept out of the bedroom. Place filtering material over the heating outlets to trap animal dander. Change the filter in furnaces and air conditioners often. - Eliminate tobacco smoke from the home. This is the single most important thing a family can do to help someone with asthma. Smoking outside the house is not enough. Family members and visitors who smoke outside carry smoke residue inside on their clothes and hair. This can trigger asthma symptoms. If you smoke, now is a good time to quit. - Avoid air pollution, industrial dust, and irritating fumes as much as possible. Updated by: Neil K.

wellbutrin xl 150. how to taper off,"Low sex drive in women (Treatment): Most women benefit from a treatment approach aimed at the many causes behind this condition. Recommendations may include sex education, counseling, and sometimes medication and hormone therapy. Sex education and counseling Talking with a sex therapist or counselor skilled in addressing sexual concerns can help with low sex drive. Therapy often includes education about sexual response and techniques. Your therapist or counselor likely will provide recommendations for reading materials or couples' exercises. Couples counseling that addresses relationship issues may also help increase feelings of intimacy and desire. Medications Your doctor will want to review the medications you're already taking, to see if any of them tend to cause sexual side effects. For example, antidepressants such as paroxetine (Paxil) and fluoxetine (Prozac, Sarafem) may lower sex drive. Switching to bupropion (Wellbutrin SR, Wellbutrin XL) - a different type of antidepressant - usually improves sex drive and is sometimes prescribed for HSDD. Along with counseling, your doctor may prescribe a medication called flibanserin (Addyi) to boost your libido. It's the first Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved treatment for premenopausal women with HSDD. You take the pill once a day, before you go to bed. Side effects include low blood pressure, dizziness, nausea and fatigue. Drinking alcohol or taking fluconazole (Diflucan), a common medication to treat vaginal yeast infections, can make these side effects worse. Hormone therapy Dryness or shrinking of the vagina (vaginal atrophy) might make sex uncomfortable and, in turn, reduce your desire. Estrogen may help relieve vaginal atrophy symptoms. However, estrogen doesn't improve sexual functioning related to hypoactive sexual desire disorder. Estrogen is available in many forms, including pills, patches, sprays and gels. Smaller doses of estrogen are found in vaginal creams and a slow-releasing suppository or ring. Ask your doctor about the risks and benefits of each form. Male hormones, such as testosterone, also play an important role in female sexual function, even though testosterone occurs in much lower amounts in women. It's not approved by the FDA for sexual dysfunction in women, but sometimes it's prescribed off-label to help lift a lagging libido. However, the use of testosterone in women is controversial. Taking it can cause acne, excess body hair, and mood or personality changes."

What is the FDA's role in side effects of drugs?,"['Before a drug can come on the market, the FDA must approve it. The New Drug Applications ( NDAs) submitted by pharmaceutical companies have, first and foremost, evidence that the drug has the effect it\'s supposed to have and is safe. This proof comes from testing the drug, first in animals and then in humans. Once the basic questions of safety and efficacy are settled, the FDA will approve the drug if it deems that its benefits outweigh its risks. Still, sometimes testing doesn\'t reveal everything about a drug\'s side effects, and they don\'t show up until after the medication enters the marketplace and more people start using it. That\'s where Med Watch comes in. The FDA\'s post-marketing surveillance program seeks voluntary input, mainly from health care professionals, on unwanted effects they see in \'\'the real world.\'\' Sometimes these reports are numerous or serious enough for the FDA to take regulatory action, such as adding warnings to a drug\'s label. This happened with the psoriasis drug Raptiva. The FDA required that the drug carry the agency\'s strongest warning, known as a black box warning, after it received reports of brain infections and meningitis in patients taking the drug. The drug was later taken off the market. The FDA also wants input from consumers when it comes to side effects. All prescription drugs, and many OTC products, must be labeled with a toll-free number the agency has for letting it know about side effects with drugs, called ""adverse events."" You can report possible new but severe side effects through Med Watch at 1-800- FDA-1088 or through the FDA website.']"

Recommended Starting Dose Schedules

1. Weekly single oral, IM or IV dose schedule: 10 to 25 mg per week until adequate response is achieved.

2. Divided oral dose schedule: 2.5 mg at 12 hour intervals for three doses.

Dosages in each schedule may be gradually adjusted to achieve optimal clinical response; 30 mg/week should not ordinarily be exceeded.

Psoriasis for past 7-8 years I had psoriasis on my scalp for nearly 10 years. Please give suggestions and medications.,"The goal of treatment is to control your symptoms and prevent infection.  Three treatment options are available:  - Skin lotions, ointments, creams, and shampoos. These are called topical treatments.  - Pills or injections that affect the body's immune response, not just the skin. These are called systemic, or body-wide, treatments.  - Phototherapy, which uses ultraviolet light to treat psoriasis.    TREATMENTS USED ON THE SKIN (TOPICAL)  Most of the time, psoriasis is treated with medicines that are placed directly on the skin or scalp. These may include:  - Cortisone creams and ointments  - Creams or ointments that contain coal tar or anthralin  - Creams to remove the scaling (usually salicylic acid or lactic acid)  - Dandruff shampoos (over-the-counter or prescription)  - Moisturizers  - Prescription medicines containing vitamin D or vitamin A (retinoids)    SYSTEMIC (BODY-WIDE) TREATMENTS  If you have very severe psoriasis, your provider will likely recommend medicines that suppress the immune system's faulty response. These medicines include methotrexate or cyclosporine. Retinoids can also be used.  Newer drugs called biologics are used when other treatments do not work. Biologics approved for the treatment of psoriasis include:  - Adalimumab (Humira)  - Etanercept (Enbrel)  - Infliximab (Remicade)  - Ustekinumab (Stelara)  - Secukinumab (Cosentyx)  - Apremilast (Otezla)    PHOTOTHERAPY  Some people may choose to have phototherapy:  - This is treatment in which your skin is carefully exposed to ultraviolet light.  - It may be given alone or after you take a drug that makes the skin sensitive to light.  - Phototherapy for psoriasis can be given as ultraviolet A (UVA) or ultraviolet B (UVB) light.   OTHER TREATMENTS  If you have an infection, your provider will prescribe antibiotics.  HOME CARE  Following these tips at home may help:   - Taking a daily bath or shower. Try not to scrub too hard because this can irritate the skin and trigger an attack.  - Oatmeal baths may be soothing and may help to loosen scales. You can use over-the-counter oatmeal bath products. Or, you can mix 1 cup of oatmeal into a tub of warm water.  - Keeping your skin clean and moist, and avoiding your specific psoriasis triggers may help reduce the number of flare-ups.  - Sunlight may help your symptoms go away. Be careful not to get sunburned.  - Relaxation and anti-stress techniques. The link between stress and flares of psoriasis is not well understood.  - Limiting the alcoholic beverages you drink may help keep psoriasis from getting worse."

Natural Treatments For many people, natural treatments can help relieve the symptoms of psoriasis. There are many natural treatments you can try on your own, but you should never use them to replace the treatment your doctor prescribes. Here are some natural treatments you may want to try. Spending a few minutes in the summer sun can help your psoriasis, but be sure to use sun block and increase time spent in the sun gradually. Applying cream from the aloe vera plant improves symptoms for some people. You should avoid aloe vera tablets. Taking fish oil orally helps some people with psoriasis. If you want to try fish oil, first speak with your doctor, as it may interact with other medications you are taking. Soaking in a solution of Dead Sea salts may improve scaling and itching. Be sure to apply moisturizer when you get out of the tub. Capsaicin, the ingredient that makes cayenne peppers hot, is the active ingredient in some topical pain-relievers. Some people find they relieve pain and itching."
Asthma I have been treated for breast cancer and had chemotherapy and readiation.  I am on many drugs but since stopping treatment I have now presented as having asthma.  I take Letrozole. 2.5 to block any estrogen in my body as my tumor was estrogen positive. What type of drugs impact asthma symptoms?   Please advise,"Asthma is caused by swelling (inflammation) in the airways. When an asthma attack occurs, the lining of the air passages swells and the muscles surrounding the airways become tight. This reduces the amount of air that can pass through the airway.  In people who have sensitive airways, asthma symptoms can be triggered by breathing in substances called allergens or triggers.   Common asthma triggers include:  - Animals (pet hair or dander)  - Dust mites  - Certain medicines (aspirin and other NSAIDS)  - Changes in weather (most often cold weather)  - Chemicals in the air or in food  - Exercise  - Mold  - Pollen  - Respiratory infections, such as the common cold  - Strong emotions (stress)  - Tobacco smoke   Substances in some workplaces can also trigger asthma symptoms, leading to occupational asthma. The most common triggers are wood dust, grain dust, animal dander, fungi, or chemicals.  Many people with asthma have a personal or family history of allergies, such as hay fever (allergic rhinitis) or eczema. Others have no history of allergies."
"Rheumatoid arthritis Dear Sir- my wife is suffering from subject since last couples of years, and recently diagnose that she is effected with subject. therefore i need your kind support for treatment and percussion step.  awaiting your kind reply and action. thanks and best Regards","RA most often requires lifelong treatment, including medicines, physical therapy, exercise, education, and possibly surgery. Early, aggressive treatment for RA can with newer drug categories can be very helpful slowing joint destruction and preventing deformities.  MEDICINES  Disease modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs): These are often the drugs that are tried first in people with RA. They are prescribed along with rest, strengthening exercise, and anti-inflammatory drugs.  - Methotrexate (Rheumatrex) is the most commonly used DMARD for rheumatoid arthritis. Leflunomide (Arava) and hydroxychloroquine may also be used.  - Sulfasalazine is an anti-inflammatory drug that is often combined with methotrexate and hydroxychloroquine (triple therapy).  - These drugs may have serious side effects, so you will need frequent blood tests when taking them.    Anti-inflammatory medications: These include aspirin and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen and naproxen.  - Although NSAIDs work well, long-term use can cause stomach problems, including ulcers and bleeding, and possible heart problems.  - Celecoxib (Celebrex) is another anti-inflammatory drug. Drugs in this class (COX-2 inhibitors) may increase heart attack and stroke risk for some people. Talk to your doctor about whether these medicines are right for you.    Antimalarial medications: This group of medicines includes hydroxychloroquine (Plaquenil). They are most often used along with methotrexate. It may be weeks or months before you see any benefit from these drugs.  Corticosteroids: These medicines work very well to reduce joint swelling and inflammation, but they can have long-term side effects. Therefore, they should be taken only for a short time and in low doses when possible.  Biologic agents: These drugs are designed to affect parts of the immune system that play a role in the disease process of rheumatoid arthritis.  They may be given when other medicines for rheumatoid arthritis have not worked. Sometimes biologic drugs are started sooner, along with other rheumatoid arthritis drugs.  Most of them are given either under the skin (subcutaneously) or into a vein (intravenously). There are different types of biologic agents:  - White blood cell modulators include: abatacept (Orencia) and rituximab (Rituxan)  - Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors include: adalimumab (Humira), etanercept (Enbrel), infliximab (Remicade), golimumab (Simponi), and certolizumab (Cimzia)  - Interleukin-6 (IL-6) inhibitors: tocilizumab (Actemra)    Biologic agents can be very helpful in treating rheumatoid arthritis. However, people taking these drugs must be watched very closely because of serious risk factors:  - Infections from bacteria, viruses, and fungi  - Leukemia or lymphoma  - Psoriasis  - Allergic reactions    Other drugs:  - Janus kinase inhibitor: Tofacitinib (Xeljanz). This is a medicine taken by mouth that is now approved for treating RA.    SURGERY  Surgery may be needed to correct severely damaged joints. Surgery may include:  - Removal of the joint lining (synovectomy)  - Total joint replacement in extreme cases; may include total knee, hip replacement, ankle replacement, shoulder replacement, and others    PHYSICAL THERAPY  Range-of-motion exercises and exercise programs prescribed by a physical therapist can delay the loss of joint function and help keep muscles strong.  Sometimes, therapists will use special machines to apply deep heat or electrical stimulation to reduce pain and improve joint movement.  Other therapies that may help ease joint pain include:  - Joint protection techniques  - Heat and cold treatments  - Splints or orthotic devices to support and align joints  - Frequent rest periods between activities, as well as 8 to 10 hours of sleep per night    NUTRITION  Some people with RA may have intolerance or allergies to certain foods. A balanced nutritious diet is recommended. It may be helpful to eat foods rich in fish oils (omega-3 fatty acids). Smoking cigarettes should be stopped. Excessive alcohol should also be avoided."

Your doctor also will figure out the severity of your asthma—that is, whether it's intermittent, mild, moderate, or severe. The level of severity will determine what treatment you'll start on.                  You may need to see an asthma specialist if:                  You need special tests to help diagnose asthma                  You've had a life-threatening asthma attack                  You need more than one kind of medicine or higher doses of medicine to control your asthma, or if you have overall problems getting your asthma well controlled                  You're thinking about getting allergy treatments                  Medical and Family Histories                  Your doctor may ask about your family history of asthma and allergies. He or she also may ask whether you have asthma symptoms and when and how often they occur.                  Let your doctor know whether your symptoms seem to happen only during certain times of the year or in certain places, or if they get worse at night.                  Your doctor also may want to know what factors seem to trigger your symptoms or worsen them. For more information about possible asthma triggers, go to ""What Are the Signs and Symptoms of Asthma?""                  Your doctor may ask you about related health conditions that can interfere with asthma management. These conditions include a runny nose, sinus infections, reflux disease, psychological stress, and sleep apnea.                  Physical Exam                  Your doctor will listen to your breathing and look for signs of asthma or allergies. These signs include wheezing, a runny nose or swollen nasal passages, and allergic skin conditions (such as eczema).                  Keep in mind that you can still have asthma even if you don't have these signs on the day that your doctor examines you.                  Diagnostic Tests                  Lung Function Test                  Your doctor will use a test called spirometry (spi-ROM-eh-tre) to check how your lungs are working. This test measures how much air you can breathe in and out. It also measures how fast you can blow air out.                  Your doctor also may give you medicine and then test you again to see whether the results have improved.                  If the starting results are lower than normal and improve with the medicine, and if your medical history shows a pattern of asthma symptoms, your diagnosis will likely be asthma.                  Other Tests                  Your doctor may recommend other tests if he or she needs more information to make a diagnosis. Other tests may include:                  Allergy testing to find out which allergens affect you, if any.                  A test to measure how sensitive your airways are. This is called a bronchoprovocation (brong-KO-prav-eh-KA-shun) test. Using spirometry, this test repeatedly measures your lung function during physical activity or after you receive increasing doses of cold air or a special chemical to breathe in.                  A test to show whether you have another condition with the same symptoms as asthma, such as reflux disease, vocal cord dysfunction, or sleep apnea.                  A chest x ray or an EKG (electrocardiogram). These tests will help find out whether a foreign object or other disease may be causing your symptoms.                  Diagnosing Asthma in Young Children                  Most children who have asthma develop their first symptoms before 5 years of age. However, asthma in young children (aged 0 to 5 years) can be hard to diagnose.                  Sometimes it's hard to tell whether a child has asthma or another childhood condition. This is because the symptoms of asthma also occur with other conditions.                  Also, many young children who wheeze when they get colds or respiratory infections don't go on to have asthma after they're 6 years old.                  A child may wheeze because he or she has small airways that become even narrower during colds or respiratory infections. The airways grow as the child grows older, so wheezing no longer occurs when the child gets colds.                  A young child who has frequent wheezing with colds or respiratory infections is more likely to have asthma if:                  One or both parents have asthma                  The child has signs of allergies, including the allergic skin condition eczema                  The child has allergic reactions to pollens or other airborne allergens                  The child wheezes even when he or she doesn't have a cold or other infection                  The most certain way to diagnose asthma is with a lung function test, a medical history, and a physical exam. However, it's hard to do lung function tests in children younger than 5 years. Thus, doctors must rely on children's medical histories, signs and symptoms, and physical exams to make a diagnosis.                  Doctors also may use a 4–6 week trial of asthma medicines to see how well a child responds."
ClinicalTrials.gov - Question - general information Trying to talk to someone about Vitiligo,"Vitiligo is a condition that causes patchy loss of skin coloring (pigmentation). The average age of onset of vitiligo is in the mid-twenties, but it can appear at any age. It tends to progress over time, with larger areas of the skin losing pigment. Some people with vitiligo also have patches of pigment loss affecting the hair on their scalp or body.  Researchers have identified several forms of vitiligo. Generalized vitiligo (also called nonsegmental vitiligo), which is the most common form, involves loss of pigment (depigmentation) in patches of skin all over the body. Depigmentation typically occurs on the face, neck, and scalp, and around body openings such as the mouth and genitals. Sometimes pigment is lost in mucous membranes, such as the lips. Loss of pigmentation is also frequently seen in areas that tend to experience rubbing, impact, or other trauma, such as the hands, arms, and places where bones are close to the skin surface (bony prominences). Another form called segmental vitiligo is associated with smaller patches of depigmented skin that appear on one side of the body in a limited area; this occurs in about 10 percent of affected individuals.  Vitiligo is generally considered to be an autoimmune disorder. Autoimmune disorders occur when the immune system attacks the body's own tissues and organs. In people with vitiligo the immune system appears to attack the pigment cells (melanocytes) in the skin. About 15 to 25 percent of people with vitiligo are also affected by at least one other autoimmune disorder, particularly autoimmune thyroid disease, rheumatoid arthritis, type 1 diabetes, psoriasis, pernicious anemia, Addison disease, or systemic lupus erythematosus.  In the absence of other autoimmune conditions, vitiligo does not affect general health or physical functioning. However, concerns about appearance and ethnic identity are significant issues for many affected individuals."

Look for water-based or ""noncomedogenic"" formulas for cosmetics and skin creams. (Noncomedogenic products have been tested and proven not to clog pores and cause acne.)      Remove all dirt or make-up. Wash once or twice a day, including after exercising.      Avoid scrubbing or repeated skin washing.      Shampoo your hair daily, especially if it is oily.      Comb or pull your hair back to keep the hair out of your face.     What NOT to do:        Try not to squeeze, scratch, pick, or rub the pimples. This can lead to skin infections and scarring.      Avoid wearing tight headbands, baseball caps, and other hats.      Avoid touching your face with your hands or fingers.      Avoid greasy cosmetics or creams.      DO NOT leave make-up on overnight.     If these steps do not clear up the blemishes, try over-the-counter acne medicines that you apply to your skin.        These products may contain benzoyl peroxide, sulfur, resorcinol, or salicylic acid.      They work by killing bacteria, drying up skin oils, or causing the top layer of your skin to peel.      They may cause redness, drying, or peeling of the skin.     A small amount of sun exposure may improve acne slightly, but tanning mostly hides the acne. Too much exposure to sunlight or ultraviolet rays is not recommended because it increases the risk for skin cancer.    MEDICINES FROM YOUR HEALTH CARE PROVIDER    If pimples are still a problem, a provider can prescribe stronger medicines and discuss other options with you.    Antibiotics may help some people with acne:        Oral antibiotics (taken by mouth) such as tetracycline, doxycycline, minocycline, erythromycin, trimethoprim, and amoxicillin      Topical antibiotics (applied to the skin) such as clindamycin, erythromycin, or dapsone     Creams or gels applied to the skin may be prescribed:        Retinoic acid cream or gel (tretinoin, Retin-A)      Prescription formulas of benzoyl peroxide, sulfur, resorcinol, or salicylic acid      Topical azelaic acid     For women whose acne is caused or made worse by hormones:        A pill called spironolactone may help.      Birth control pills may help in some cases, though they may make acne worse in some women.     Minor procedures or treatments may also be helpful:        A laser procedure called photodynamic therapy may be used.      Your provider may also suggest chemical skin peeling; removal of scars by dermabrasion; or removal, drainage, or injection of cysts with cortisone.     People who have cystic acne and scarring may try a medicine called isotretinoin (Accutane). You will be watched closely when taking this medicine because of its side effects.    Pregnant women should NOT take Accutane, because it causes severe birth defects.        Women taking Accutane must use 2 forms of birth control before starting the drug and enroll in the iPledge program.      Men also need to be enrolled in the iPledge program.      Your provider will follow you on this drug and you will have regular blood tests."
"hair loss new acne and coarse hair on face hi there i am losing my hair i,m a women by the way and i am getting spots every day big lump spots and now the hairs on my face are now showing they have become coarse please could you help me i dont go out anymore im so ashamed of myself.","Effective treatments for some types of hair loss are available. But some hair loss is permanent. With some conditions, such as patchy alopecia, hair may regrow without treatment within a year.    Treatments for hair loss include medications, surgery, laser therapy, and wigs or hairpieces. Your doctor may suggest a combination of these approaches in order to get the best results.    The goals of treatment are to promote hair growth, slow hair loss or hide hair loss.  Medication    If your hair loss is caused by an underlying disease, treatment for that disease will be necessary. This may include drugs to reduce inflammation and suppress your immune system, such as prednisone. If a certain medication is causing the hair loss, your doctor may advise you to stop using it for at least three months.    Medications are available to treat pattern baldness. Two medications approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat hair loss are:        Minoxidil (Rogaine). Minoxidil is an over-the-counter liquid or foam that you rub into your scalp twice a day to grow hair and to prevent further hair loss. It may be used by men and women. With this treatment, some people experience hair regrowth, a slower rate of hair loss or both. The effect peaks at 16 weeks and you need to keep applying the medication to retain benefits.        Possible side effects include scalp irritation, unwanted hair growth on the adjacent skin of the face and hands, and rapid heart rate (tachycardia).        Finasteride (Propecia). This prescription drug is available only to men. It's taken daily in pill form. Many men taking finasteride experience a slowing of hair loss, and some may show some new hair growth. You need to keep taking it to retain benefits.        Rare side effects of finasteride include diminished sex drive and sexual function and an increased risk of prostate cancer. Women who are or may be pregnant need to avoid touching crushed or broken tablets.    Surgery    In the most common type of permanent hair loss, only the top of the head is affected. Hair transplant or restoration surgery can make the most of the hair you have left.    During this procedure, your surgeon removes tiny plugs of skin, each containing a few hairs, from the back or sides of your scalp. He or she then implants the plugs into the bald sections of your scalp. You may be asked to take a hair loss medication before and after surgery to improve results.    Surgical procedures to treat baldness are expensive and can be painful. Possible risks include infection and scarring.  Wigs and hairpieces    You may want to try a wig or a hairpiece as an alternative to medical treatment or if you don't respond to treatment. It can be used to cover either permanent or temporary hair loss. Quality, natural-looking wigs and hairpieces are available.    If your hair loss is due to a medical condition, the cost of a wig may be covered by insurance. You'll need a prescription for the wig from your doctor."
Psoriasis for past 7-8 years I had psoriasis on my scalp for nearly 10 years. Please give suggestions and medications.,"Topical treatments, such as moisturizers, over-the-counter and prescriptions creams and shampoos, typically are used for mild psoriasis.  Treating moderate to severe psoriasis usually involves a combination of treatment strategies. Besides topical treatments, your doctor your doctor may prescribe phototherapy (also known as light therapy). Your doctor may also prescribe systemic medications, including biologic drugs, especially if your psoriasis is significantly impacting your quality of life."
"Skin Itching At night, I have very bad lower leg skin itching.
